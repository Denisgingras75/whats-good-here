## Photo-to-Rate Flow

**Summary:** Let users photograph their food, match it to a dish, and rate it later.

**Flow:**
1. User takes photo of their food
2. AI + location tries to match to existing dish in database
3. If match found → save to "rate later" queue
4. If no match → user can add the dish (photo already attached)
5. Reminder when user opens app: "You have dishes to rate!"

**Why it's good:**
- Users already love photographing food - capture that moment
- Reduces friction (no searching while eating)
- Crowdsources database growth when dishes aren't found
- Gets user-submitted photos for dish cards

**Technical needs:**
- OpenAI Vision API or Google Cloud Vision for photo analysis
- Supabase Storage for photos
- New `pending_ratings` table
- Reminder system (in-app first, push notifications later)

**Suggested approach:**
- v1: Skip AI matching. Photo → pick restaurant → pick or add dish → rate later
- v2: Add AI matching once dish database is larger

## Pre-Launch Data Seeding

**Goal:** Have enough real data that new users see value immediately.

**Approach:** Founders rate 50+ dishes before public launch. These are real ratings, not fake seeds.

**Why this works:**
- 100% authentic data
- No "disappearing ratings" confusion
- Founders ARE users — this is dogfooding
- No trust erosion later

**Targets before launch:**
- 50+ dish ratings across 10+ restaurants
- Cover major categories (pizza, seafood, breakfast, etc.)
- Hit the popular spots tourists will search for

**Soft launch option:**
- Invite 20 friends for 2 weeks before public launch
- Get to 100+ ratings before marketing push

## Gamification Framework

**Bottom line:** Phase 1 gamification = visibility of impact + identity as a contributor.

**Golden Rule:** If a mechanic risks inflating scores, biasing ratings, or low-effort behavior — it does not ship.

**NOT building:** Streaks, leaderboards, XP/points, Yelp Elite nonsense

**Phase 1 (Implemented):**
- Impact feedback after rating ("This dish entered Top 10", "You moved this up 2 spots")
- Contribution count on profile ("You've rated X dishes")
- "Needs X votes to rank" progress indicators
- Contribution language throughout ("Add Your Vote", "Help rank this dish")

**Phase 2 (After traction):**
- Contribution levels: Explorer → Contributor → Tastemaker → Local Legend
- Trust-based unlocks (suggest dishes, flag data, curate lists)

**Phase 3 (Restaurants involved):**
- Specials voting
- Community favorite badges (earned, not paid)

## Bot Protection & Vote Integrity

**Summary:** Prevent bots and fake accounts from gaming the rankings.

**Already in place:**
- One vote per user per dish (database constraint)
- Authentication required (Google OAuth or magic link email)
- Email verification inherent in auth flow

**Future measures (if needed):**
- Rate limiting: Max 20 votes per hour per user
- New account cooldown: Can't vote for first 10 minutes after signup
- Negative vote streak limit: Can't rate 5 dishes in a row below 3 (prevents brigading/tanking a restaurant)
- Suspicious pattern detection: Flag accounts that vote on same restaurant repeatedly
- Phone verification: Optional, unlocks "verified voter" badge
- Device fingerprinting: Detect multiple accounts from same device

**What NOT to do:**
- CAPTCHA on every vote (kills UX)
- Require phone number upfront (too much friction)
- Public vote history (privacy concern)

**Philosophy:** Start with light protection, add friction only if abuse appears. Don't punish real users for hypothetical bots.

## Search Autocomplete

**Summary:** Show matching suggestions as user types in search.

**Flow:**
1. User starts typing in search field
2. Dropdown shows matching dishes and restaurants
3. User can tap a suggestion to go directly to that item
4. Or press enter to see full search results

**Why it's good:**
- Reduces typing friction
- Helps users discover dishes they didn't know existed
- Standard UX pattern users expect

**Technical needs:**
- Debounced search query (300ms)
- Combined query for dishes + restaurants
- Dropdown component with keyboard navigation

---

## No Results State

**Summary:** When search returns nothing, show helpful suggestions instead of empty screen.

**Flow:**
1. User searches for something with no matches
2. Instead of blank screen, show:
   - "No dishes found for 'X'"
   - "Try searching for: [popular categories]"
   - "Or browse nearby restaurants"

**Why it's good:**
- Prevents dead-end frustration
- Guides users toward content that exists
- Easy win for UX polish

**Technical needs:**
- Simple conditional render
- Curated list of popular search terms
- Link to browse/restaurants pages

---

## Sorting Options

**Summary:** Let users sort dish lists by different criteria.

**Options:**
- Closest (distance)
- Most voted (total votes, high to low)
- Trending (recent vote velocity)
- Recently added

**Why it's good:**
- Users have different intents (exploring vs. deciding now)
- "Most voted" surfaces trusted dishes
- "Closest" helps when hungry NOW

**Technical needs:**
- Sort dropdown component
- Update RPC function or client-side sort
- Persist preference in localStorage
