The second time I ordered a burrito online I got a rice and bean burrito, once I opened I saw it was only rice and beans…. I went back in to complain and the cashier tried to tell me I was wrong until I showed her my online order. I gave them another chance recently and got another rice and bean burrito! The burrito was all rice!!!!! Probably 2 pieces of beans in there. if I wanted just a rice burrito that’s what I would order but I didn’t. They just have 0 consistency, they either nail your order or they completely mess it up.\n\nOnline ordering should have way more options than it does.

We received notification that it was ready at 5:28 -- perfect! Walked in. Actually not ready. Due to an unexplained \"mistake\" in the kitchen, we had to wait 30 minutes, and with six little children sitting in the car, and sunset at 6:10, this wasn't ideal. It would have been a nice touch to offer something to make up for it, but other than \"it'll be a few more minutes,\" nobody said anything. Sitting in an empty restaurant watching the clock is no fun.\n\nSo did I expect to be posting a 1-star review? Yeah. But I'm not, because, honestly, the pizza is ridiculously good. So good, that frankly, it's worth the wait. We got a GF pepperoni (heads up, that comes in small -- the Instacart menu didn't indicate, so we thought it was going to be bigger) and Talia's Choice (artichoke, garlic, mushroom, pesto). Quite possibly the best pizza I've ever had, and I would try it again.",

From the moment I walked in, the atmosphere was warm and inviting, setting the perfect tone for a delightful meal. The restaurant exudes cleanliness and attention to detail, creating a comfortable environment for diners.\n\nThe service at Mikado was truly outstanding. The staff was attentive, courteous, and entertained conversation, I sat in the bar area, which made the dining experience even more enjoyable. They were prompt in taking orders and ensured that everything was to my satisfaction.\n\nOne of the highlights for me was the soothing background music that enhanced the overall ambiance. It created a relaxing atmosphere, allowing me to savor my meal in a peaceful setting.\n\nI opted for the floral green tea, and I must say, the flavor is delightful! The tea had a subtle, yet distinct, floral note that complemented the meal perfectly.\n\nAs for the main course, I chose the Kung Pao chicken, and it didn't disappoint! The dish was expertly prepared, with the perfect balance of spicy and savory flavors. The chicken was tender, and the accompanying vegetables were fresh and crisp, showcasing the chef's skill and attention to quality ingredients.\n\nOverall, my visit to Mikado was a memorable one, thanks to its excellent service from Cindy, pristine environment, inviting ambiance, and delicious offerings. I would highly recommend this restaurant to future visitors seeking a top-notch dining experience.",

    "full_review": "Who knew a bowling alley could have such great food?\n\nWe were skeptical when we were told how good the food is at Barn Bowl & Bistro, but having been there about a dozen times now, we're convinced. They serve up great dishes with consistency and at a reasonable price for the Island.\n\nMost recently I had their Brazilian churrasco bbq...where they come to your table with skewers of meat and slice off what you want. At $34.99, it's an awesome deal for some delicious meats. It comes with three sides: rice, a salsa of sorts, and a third dish which I didn't catch the name of but was quite tasty. Currently, they're talking about offering it on Saturdays - maybe Fridays - so call first. And go support them so they continue to serve it up!\n\nOther suggestions...the shrimp and sausage pasta is great as are the pizzas. I haven't had the curry but friends have and thoroughly enjoyed it. Personally, I've had the scallops, Bang Bang Cauliflower, SW Chicken Egg Rolls, and the Fried Fishermans Platter - which can serve two. All are good. A lot of folks tout the fried chicken but the night my husband had it, it wasn't well seasoned. And rumor has it there might be better fish and chips elsewhere.\n\nThe restaurant is clean and comfortable. The staff is awesome and they mix great drinks. All in all, it's an establishment we'll continue to enjoy and support.\n\nOh, and the bowling is great too!",

The flounder sandwich is wonderful. The fish is fresh and perfectly fried lightly and then stuffed into the bun. All the fried foods are fresh and delicious. The seafood is amazing too. The real stars are the ready to go soups and items that are made in house and stock the shelves. The lobster bisque is fantastic. A sandwich, lobster bisque, and the gorgeous sunsets is all anyone really needs. Check it out. We recommend.\n\nTLDR excellent fried and fresh seafood",

There’s everything you’d expect to find at a general store, along with a counter-service kitchen where you can get a great lobster roll, a smoothie, and more. While it is expensive, it’s not out of line compared with other spots on Martha’s Vineyard. They have a nice little outdoor dining area to enjoy if you don’t want to take it to go. While I didn’t get a souvenir, the T-shirts they sell taught me how to properly pronounce Katama, the cherry on top for me!",

The nachos were just as she remembered: crispy, cheesy, and loaded. The quesadillas were packed with flavor and grilled perfectly, and the wings were hot, crispy, and juicy.\n\nThe food came out quickly, the staff was super friendly, and the whole atmosphere was fun and casual, perfect for a memorable meal with family. Sharky’s truly made our reunion special. Highly recommend!",

It was hard choosing between the sandwiches, and I really want to go back for salads and tinned fish.\n\nGot to sit on the couch in the back by the N64, also an added bonus. Plus the staff were super friendly and helped us decide what to order. Pictured are the filet-o-fish, hot beef sandwich, waffle fries, and the oatmeal chocolate cookie.",

Note... they do offer free water, I didn't notice until after I had bought a water. Make sure you grab a cookie, the size of your head, before you head out! My pick lemon sugar!!

Super easy place to get to from the water once you know where it is, a dinghy dock right in front is super helpful.\nDinner was amazing start to finish. Our Waiter was top knotch and the somm was on point.  Great menu that was well executed, and a great wine list that was super fun to explore. We will be back when we come around again.\nWe had local oysters, Tuna Poke, Halibut Hamachi, beetroot gnocchi, mussels, a super cool carrot dish for 1st and second courses. We then had Char, Sea Bass, Halibut, Scallops.  Each one was spot on. The Scallops were some of the best any of us had every had. The fish dishes were all great with perfectly cooked fish and interesting flavors complementing the fish.\n\nHighly reccommend!",

Spacious bar with a good selection of drinks and spirits.  Kevin the bartender was very attentive in spite of being busy.\n\nSpeciality old fashioned and Manhattan for cocktails.  Both were very good.   We ordered a couple of appetizers rather than meals.\n\nHighly recommend the Brussel Sprouts. Great flavor and enough to share.  The Shrimp and Crab cocktail had a good flavor but not stellar.  We were surprised how small the shrimp were especially at $28.  I would not recommend the shrimp.\n\nOverall a great spot and would eat here again.",

    "full_review": "Nancy’s was everything. From the second we sat down, we knew we were in for something special. Let’s start with the fries — so crispy, so golden, so delectable they honestly might’ve changed our lives. Easily the star of the table and not just an afterthought side.\n\nThe service? Incredible. Attentive and kind without ever hovering — they struck the perfect balance between friendly and chill. Even the water was a highlight: icy, crisp, and self-serve (which we loved).\n\nWe ordered a lot (the portions were huge) but were pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to box things up to bring home — it was all so filling in the best way. The Greek salad was fresh, flavorful, and everything you want from a salad. And the buffalo chicken wrap? Absolutely hit the spot — packed with flavor and paired with amazing sides.\n\nThe atmosphere was its own kind of magic — bustly, coastal, and the perfect blend of casual and classy. The place had such a welcoming, cultural vibe — families, friends, reunions, locals, and tourists all mixed in together. The menu had so many diverse options, it felt like everyone could find something they loved.\n\nAll in all? Nancy’s nailed it. The food, the vibe, the service — everything. Couldn’t have asked for a better meal or a better place to spend our evening.\nFive out of five. Would go again in a heartbeat.",

Vault turned into wine cave, safe door become a communal table and decorations reminiscent of the bank that once stood there give this restaurant a quirky museum touch. The food and cocktails are pricy which leaves you with the expectation for an amazing culinary journey. Cassoulet is delicious but overwhelming in size. Best to be mindful of all the mains being oversized when ordering. It's a nice treat when on the Vineyard.",

    "full_review": "The decor is lovely. The chef hit it out of the park on flavors, Five Stars. Wines by the glass were terrific. The mezze appetizer could not have been better. But that’s where the good news ended. A restaurant that is always changing its menu runs a risk, the same way that specials at a restaurant are not always as good as the tried and true. It must be difficult for the kitchen at The Ocean Club with all their changing up.\nPoint in fact, the lasagna bolognese was so dry it may have been the worst thing I have ever ordered. Tasted great flavor wise and the filling would have been nice on pasta (think meaty bolognese that runs on the dry side, clinging to rigatoni), but honestly I could not cut it thin enough to eat and the sparse amount of yummy sauce on the plate that I dipped it in soon ran out. The half duck that (per our server)  took days to prepare had a sauce with a delectable flavor, but the meat was oddly grey and mushy. Maybe cooked too long via sous vide or other method?\nI hope they decide to land on a few tried and true menu items, and if they want to get creative, vary the sauce seasonings or sub out an ingredient here and there. Not major shifting like they are doing. Or better yet, leave a core set of selections alone and don’t mess with perfection.",

Not to worry though We grabbed some snacks, coffee, and shopped a bit at all the other Black Dog spots until we were able to be seated at 12:30 with a bunch of other families who were all also waiting to eat. Atmosphere inside is great and you can’t beat the nostalgia factor. Crab spinach and artichoke dip was incredibly good. The lobster rolls were the best we’ve had yet in the Cape Cod area (although the coleslaw left something to be desired). Caesar salad was pretty standard and the crab cakes were just ok. The sauce and corn was good but the crab cakes were too thin and too fried for my taste. The presentation also could use some work.\n\nOther than the service not being the greatest and the unkind hostess, we had a lovely time with beautiful views and tasty food!",

It comes as a takeout and includes a lot of melted butter for dipping your lobster, creamy coleslaw, choice of two different soups, and stuffed clam! No worries, hand sanitizers included or go to the bathrooms nearby! If weather permits, sit outside to eat and then wait for the sunset!! Amazing!!!

It’s got that cozy-meets-cool energy, with a DJ spinning and setting the tone without overpowering the room. We kicked things off with a round of great cocktails and then dove into the food - the burrata ravioli was rich and dreamy, the calamari was perfectly crispy with delicious aioli, and we tried a lineup of burgers that did not disappoint. The Cellar feels like a hidden gem under one of the island’s classic spot - laid-back but still polished, and a super fun place to post up for dinner or drinks.",

Atmosphere is very fun, I’d recommend for the vibe and a drink but would not recommend the food it was only mediocre. Wings, fries, and soda were $33 which is not too bad for MV!",

We ordered our drinks and apps and they came in just a couple minutes.  For dinner I had the seafood pad Thai.  I ordered it as 3 star spicy, the hottest they offered.  It came to the table and it was presented nicely on the plate.  The texture was perfect to my liking and the heat made the dish exceptional. I have a high heat tolerance so it was not too spicy for me personally, but it truly enhanced the dish.  It was bursting with flavor.  As we finished, the restaurant was filling up with patrons and every one was greeted with a smile and warm welcome.  This restaurant is a must try.",

The scallop crudo was a masterpiece of restraint — impossibly fresh, delicate, kissed with just the right acidity to let the sea speak for itself.

    "full_review": "We had an incredible experience at Bettini, made even more memorable by the outstanding service from bartenders Hunter and Taylor. We were celebrating my friend's new job in LA, so we wanted somewhere we could feel extra special celebrating.\n\nSitting at the bar was the perfect choice — the atmosphere was welcoming, the conversation flowed easily, and the bartenders professionalism truly stood out. Hunter crafted what was hands down the best espresso martini we’ve ever had, setting the tone for a fantastic evening. Taylor made us one of the signature cocktails of Bettini as well and truly - another five star drink to start the night. The ambiance at Bettini strikes a perfect balance between elegant and inviting, making it an ideal spot for a relaxed yet elevated night out.\n\nThe food was equally impressive. We started with the beef skewers, which were incredibly tender, and the shrimp empanadas, which were perfectly crisp and flavorful. The gnocchi with wild mushrooms and truffle was a standout — rich, decadent, and absolutely delicious. The chicken dish was spectacular, beautifully cooked and full of flavor. We ended on a sweet note with the chocolate torte, a lovely finish to an unforgettable meal. If you're visiting Edgartown, a meal at Bettini is a must and we highly recommend grabbing a seat at the bar — between the amazing service, exquisite food, and lively ambiance, it’s an experience you won’t want to miss. Taylor and Hunter are true professionals and we look forward to coming in again and telling all our friends about our experience!",

    "full_review": "Amazing Oysters & Laid-Back Island Vibes\n\nOur first attempt to visit Nomans was on a Friday night—unknowingly right when it seemed like everyone on the island had the same idea! We decided to try again on Saturday afternoon, and I’m so glad we did. The vibes were still popping, but without the long wait.\n\nMolly, the bartender, was fantastic—friendly, welcoming, and pouring some truly delicious drinks. We enjoyed a couple of Mai Tais and a strong Old Fashioned before diving into the main event: the oysters. And let me tell you… these were AH-mazing—so fresh, so tasty, just downright guuud! We started with a half dozen, but they were so good we had to order another half dozen. I can honestly say these are probably the best oysters I’ve had to date.\n\nOur kids enjoyed playing a few games while we relaxed, and we also tried the cod sandwich—perfectly cooked, with a flavorful aioli that really stood out. The fries were fresh, hot, and tasty. The music (not live) added to the already chill, island vibe, making it even easier to kick back and enjoy the afternoon.\n\nI’m so glad our plans shifted to Saturday instead of Friday—it made for the perfect, laid-back island experience. We’ll definitely be back!",

We had the lobster dip app which came with warm pita chips. The dip itself was loaded with fresh lobster and was mouth watering spectacular.  I ordered  lobster roll in butter accompanied with fries.  The lobster was sweet and tender as it should be.  It was heavenly good.  Our waitress was smiling, friendly and just an all around great waitress.  She checked back with us often and we appreciated her efforts.",

Wonderful views over the harbor and you can watch the Chappy ferry on its constant back and forth journey. Service was good. The lobster roll was served with fries and had lots of chunk lobster – seemed to be a good value.  The Clam Chowder had a good flavor and was very creamy.  The fried shrimp platter was okay, but seemed a bit overpriced for the amount of shrimp. The winner was the lobster dip appetizer, served with lots of crispy pita bread. We also loved the Ocean Berry Booze cocktail. Would go back for the dip, cocktail and the great views. Outside seating was very full when we left around 7:30 pm.",

    "full_review": "Rosewater is a fantastic spot for a casual meal in Edgartown. The place was busy when I visited, but the service was efficient and quick — a sign of how popular it is. As a first-time customer traveling for work, I wasn’t disappointed. The sandwich I ordered was excellent, full of flavor, and the coffee was just as good. It’s a great place to stop with the whole family, with both indoor and outdoor seating options. Highly recommend if you’re in town and looking for a tasty bite with friendly, fast service.",

I ordered bacon egg and cheese on a homemade English muffin. FYI they only have cheddar or goat cheese for cheese options. It was hot fresh and yummy.\nHubby had the loaded hash browns and added scrambled eggs but no sour cream. When I opened the container to take a picture it was not what I was expecting but hubby said it was good. It must have been because he did not share!! We will be back tomorrow for the gluten free treats!!Hubby also had a medium roast coffee he said it was good but loves cream in his coffee but he has yet to find cream on the island.",

It was such a large portion I thought I would never finish it, I was wrong, I ate ever last bite and the fries along with it!  The hubby enjoyed his burger and fries also.  We sat at the bar with a view of the water.  Service was excellent.  The bartender recommended which lobster roll to get and I am so happy with the choice.  Drinks: Tito’s & lemonade and the hubby got a local IPA.🍺\nClean bathrooms.",

    "full_review": "Perfect Kickoff to Our Martha’s Vineyard Stay\n\nLookout Tavern was the very first restaurant we visited when we arrived on the island, and it set the tone for a fantastic trip. Our party of six enjoyed a total of four (maybe five!) warm lobster rolls, one shrimp platter, four rum punches, and one or two lemonades—and everything was fresh, flavorful, and delicious. The lobster rolls were especially memorable—tender lobster meat, perfectly seasoned, and served warm.\n\nBefore our meals arrived, we shared calamari and fried oysters as appetizers, and both were absolutely delicious—crispy, well-seasoned, and the perfect way to start the meal.\n\nWhen we arrived, we were told the wait might be around 30 minutes, but in reality, it was only about 10. That gave us just enough time to take a quick walk across the pier and enjoy the view before being seated. We were placed at a comfortable picnic table with a great view of the lively scene around us—people enjoying good food, great weather, and relaxed island vibes.\n\nThe service was friendly, the food came out quickly, and the overall atmosphere made for the perfect kickoff to our stay on the Vineyard. We will absolutely be back on our next visit—especially for those lobster rolls!",

The sandwich just didn’t taste right. Another member of my party ordered a burger well done and it still had some pink in it.

Located inside the hotel, the ambiance is perfect for an intimate dinner or a family outing. The hostess and staff were friendly and professional, making the evening even more enjoyable.\n\nI began my meal with the pan-seared, spice-crusted fresh La Belle Farm duck foie gras, which was honestly the best foie gras I've ever tasted. The charred factor added a unique twist, enhancing the flavor without overpowering the delicate texture, allowing the foie gras to still melt in your mouth.\n\nFor the entrée, I chose the étuvée of 1 1/2-pound Menemsha lobster, a dish bursting with flavor. The sauce, highlighted by roasted garlic, truly made the lobster shine. To finish, I enjoyed an espresso martini, one of the best I've had in a long time. This version used chocolate liquor, offering a delightful twist on the classic drink.\n\nWhile I wasn't a fan of the \"Matcha My Freak\" and \"Whistle While You Work\" cocktails, I suspect it was more due to my personal taste preferences. Despite this, I am eager to return and try other drinks on the menu.\n\nOverall, L’étoile Restaurant is a fantastic location for an elegant dining experience. I highly recommend it for those seeking a sophisticated meal in a picturesque setting.",

It was a cool summer night with soft blues playing from a bar close by.   We had Oysters Two-Styles.  I Never had an oyster with cream in the shell, very good and std vinegar type. Excellent.  The Menemsha Lobster was prepared perfectly and so was the Rack of  Lamb Chops.   I would go back in a heartbeat but it took months to get a reservation.

    "full_review": "My husband and I had dinner at l'etoile for our wedding anniversary and we're impressed by the restaurant's ambience, food, and level of service.\n\nFood:\n- Braised short ribs ($22) were delicious but it was the maple-smoked cheddar polenta that temped us to lick the plate clean\n- Lamb chop ($52) was delicious, no gamey-ness at all. The accompanying spinach and roast tomato grape leaf tartlet seemed random but was very tasty!\n- Lobster ($68) was delicious, as was the pasta. That said, this entree was spendy.\n\nAmbience:\nLike many businesses in Edgartown, this restaurant is in a house, with seating on the front lawn on Adirondack chairs, inside in tastefully renovated rooms with mood lighting, or outside under a semi-permanent tent that still has tables dressed with white tablecloths and decorated as tastefully as the restaurant's indoor dining tables.\n\nService:\nThe staff were very friendly, attentive, well-trained, quick with the water refills, and not too stuffy or pompous. We felt very welcome!\n\nParking:\nStreet parking only, which can be hard to come by in the area, even during the off season.",
