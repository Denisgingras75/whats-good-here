The second time I ordered a burrito online I got a rice and bean burrito, once I opened I saw it was only rice and beans…. I went back in to complain and the cashier tried to tell me I was wrong until I showed her my online order. I gave them another chance recently and got another rice and bean burrito! The burrito was all rice!!!!! Probably 2 pieces of beans in there. if I wanted just a rice burrito that’s what I would order but I didn’t. They just have 0 consistency, they either nail your order or they completely mess it up.\n\nOnline ordering should have way more options than it does. Very basic burritos, not much to it, if you order a steak burrito sometimes it comes with enough and other times you get two pieces if that.",

I took one star off for the way their credit card check out process pushes higher tip percentages. I like to tip, and I like to tip well. However, a counter-serve where you stand in line to order and come back to get your own food when it’s done loses a star for providing a minimum tip percentage option of 18% at checkout.  That should be minimum for a full-service gig.  It leaves a bad taste in my mouth, and I would rather go somewhere that appreciates those kind of tips rather than expects it as their due.  Fair food, fair price for the area, but they lose me on the service front for that.",

    "text": "I think people like this place because it’s mostly all outdoors, including the bar, which gave it a cool atmosphere. The staff was nice but, the food was not so nice.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered for us while I was in the restroom (which the toilet seat was barely holding on) and when our food came, I noticed green thick sauce on my taco. The menu said tomatillo sauce, but that didn’t look like tomatillo. We asked the server if it has avocado in it and he said yes. I’m unfortunately allergic to avocado and right then told the waiter I was. Since my bf didn’t tell them of my allergy when ordering (he didn’t because nothing said guacamole or avocado in the description) I just told the waiter it was fine and gave my bf the tacos. Let me say though, I don’t understand the deal with putting avocado in everything like, verde or tomatillo salsa?!\n\nMoving on: this is long, bear with me.\n1- The corn tortilla wasn’t homemade, that’s fine- it’s an island, but it was chewy from being over greased and heated on the grill.\n2-My frozen margarita was more like a sloshy attempt at being frozen.\n3-Now, the salsa is where it really counts for me since, I was born and raised in California. It was absolutely not salsa at all. It was essentially red enchilada sauce, red pepper flakes, and cilantro. What’s a girl gotta do to get some sort of tomato around here? 👀👀 I mean, I still ate some because, everything is expensive on MV and I had to give my taco away. So, skip the salsa, you’d be better off having their “gringo salsa” or pico de gallo.",

Walked in. Actually not ready. Due to an unexplained \"mistake\" in the kitchen, we had to wait 30 minutes, and with six little children sitting in the car, and sunset at 6:10, this wasn't ideal. It would have been a nice touch to offer something to make up for it, but other than \"it'll be a few more minutes,\" nobody said anything. Sitting in an empty restaurant watching the clock is no fun.\n\nSo did I expect to be posting a 1-star review? Yeah. But I'm not, because, honestly, the pizza is ridiculously good. So good, that frankly, it's worth the wait. We got a GF pepperoni (heads up, that comes in small -- the Instacart menu didn't indicate, so we thought it was going to be bigger) and Talia's Choice (artichoke, garlic, mushroom, pesto). Quite possibly the best pizza I've ever had, and I would try it again.",

They have vegan cheese but the dough has eggs in it so, sadly, they DO NOT have vegan pizza. Which is super weird and unnecessary, pizza dough does not typically have eggs. Just because a restaurant offers a vegan item does not mean the item is actually vegan. As someone with allergy to eggs I find this misinformation very dangerous.",

The food takes a long time to come out, and although it tastes very good, the service really ruins the experience.\n\nAnother huge issue is that there’s no bathroom available for customers. My 3-year-old son needed to use it urgently, and the only response we got was, “it’s not working, it’s not working.” I was very upset, because he’s just a child and obviously cannot hold it the same way an adult can.\n\nOn top of that, the staff don’t even bring the food to the table — customers have to go get it themselves — and yet they still expect us to pay tips for such poor service.\n\nThis restaurant really needs to improve its customer service, because the food alone is not enough to make people want to come back.",

And the amount of lettuce is minimal. It’s ridiculous to sell something like this for that price! My experience with this company is always bad, and I thought long and hard before buying this salad again, but hunger got the best of me and I gave this place one more chance — and as expected, it was a horrible experience!!

The highlight was definitely the cocktails and the cute mason jars.\n\nIn terms of decor and ambiance , the space feels homely and cozy with a gorgeous patio. I would definitely recommend coming here for a chill date or afternoon outing with friends or family.\n\nThe staff was friendly and the wait time was short.",

The staff was attentive, courteous, and entertained conversation, I sat in the bar area, which made the dining experience even more enjoyable. They were prompt in taking orders and ensured that everything was to my satisfaction.\n\nOne of the highlights for me was the soothing background music that enhanced the overall ambiance. It created a relaxing atmosphere, allowing me to savor my meal in a peaceful setting.\n\nI opted for the floral green tea, and I must say, the flavor is delightful! The tea had a subtle, yet distinct, floral note that complemented the meal perfectly.\n\nAs for the main course, I chose the Kung Pao chicken, and it didn't disappoint! The dish was expertly prepared, with the perfect balance of spicy and savory flavors. The chicken was tender, and the accompanying vegetables were fresh and crisp, showcasing the chef's skill and attention to quality ingredients.\n\nOverall, my visit to Mikado was a memorable one, thanks to its excellent service from Cindy, pristine environment, inviting ambiance, and delicious offerings. I would highly recommend this restaurant to future visitors seeking a top-notch dining experience.",

    "text": "Who knew a bowling alley could have such great food?\n\nWe were skeptical when we were told how good the food is at Barn Bowl & Bistro, but having been there about a dozen times now, we're convinced. They serve up great dishes with consistency and at a reasonable price for the Island.\n\nMost recently I had their Brazilian churrasco bbq...where they come to your table with skewers of meat and slice off what you want. At $34.99, it's an awesome deal for some delicious meats. It comes with three sides: rice, a salsa of sorts, and a third dish which I didn't catch the name of but was quite tasty. Currently, they're talking about offering it on Saturdays - maybe Fridays - so call first. And go support them so they continue to serve it up!\n\nOther suggestions...the shrimp and sausage pasta is great as are the pizzas. I haven't had the curry but friends have and thoroughly enjoyed it. Personally, I've had the scallops, Bang Bang Cauliflower, SW Chicken Egg Rolls, and the Fried Fishermans Platter - which can serve two. All are good. A lot of folks tout the fried chicken but the night my husband had it, it wasn't well seasoned. And rumor has it there might be better fish and chips elsewhere.\n\nThe restaurant is clean and comfortable. The staff is awesome and they mix great drinks. All in all, it's an establishment we'll continue to enjoy and support.\n\nOh, and the bowling is great too!",

    "text": "I had a very unpleasant experience at Rocco's Pizzeria. It was not open yet, and I wasn't getting food there. I was sitting with my dog on the deck surrounding Rocco's one morning, waiting for my family, as they were grabbing drinks at a nearby coffee shop. A man suddenly burst through a side door near the pizza place, and I am assuming it was the owner of Rocco's himself. He immediately started lecturing me in an aggressive tone about how my dog was not allowed on the deck. He barely let me get an apology in as he just about chased me off the deck. He continued to go off about how allowing dogs in outdoor areas costs extra money for him (not true), and how he doesn't like dogs, so I needed to leave immediately. The interaction was completely unnecessary. I would have gladly walked away with no issue if he had approached me in a friendlier manner. I understand pets are not allowed within food preparation areas, but I had no idea that included outdoor spaces. I used to enjoy Rocco's Pizza, but I will not be returning after this incident. It was so rude, and no one should be spoken to that way, especially a potential customer. It also says a lot that this guy that he doesn't like dogs.",

Not the best mini golf course I’ve ever played but had a great time with the fam nonetheless.  Biggest complaint is the holes are uneven so the ball rolls back sometimes or gets stuck up against the wall.  $12 for adults and $10 for kids.",

Maybe that’s part of the charm? The lack of lighting on the back holes could be conducive to skunks or other mischief.

The quesadillas were packed with flavor and grilled perfectly, and the wings were hot, crispy, and juicy.\n\nThe food came out quickly, the staff was super friendly, and the whole atmosphere was fun and casual, perfect for a memorable meal with family.

She was attentive, friendly, and made sure our dining experience was top-notch from start to finish. Her recommendations were spot on, and she went above and beyond to make us feel welcome.\n\nThe lively atmosphere, combined with the fantastic food—especially those nachos—and outstanding service from Tass and Anna, makes Sharky’s Cantina a standout spot in Oak Bluffs.

Tables tend to be closer together because of how busy it gets, and there are a lot of hard surfaces, meaning things can get a little loud.\n\nService was the right level of attentive: staff were very friendly and they were good about clearing plates and utensils when it’s clear diners are done eating. The daily fish specials are posted on a chalkboard inside.\n\nOverall, the food was very good. The buffalo brussel sprouts with whipped blue cheese were very good but for $18? Feels steep. My husband enjoyed his tuna, which was served like an elevated poke bowl and had Asian influences. I got the seared cut cod special, and enjoyed the sweet corn and mushroom risotto that came on the side: it was appropriately warm and cozy feeling for the rainy day, and brightened by the bursts of sweet freshness from the corn.",

They remind me of what IHOP used to be when I was growing up. Ask for maple syrup if you prefer that. I wish I lived closer to this spot because it would be my local favorite ❤️.",

The fish and chips were a very large portion that we couldn’t finish after the spring rolls and side salads. We took the leftovers home and ate them the next day and it was still delicious.",

When I arrived, I immediately was greeted with lackluster customer service - from the host and especially from my waitress (throughout the night she kept asking did I want a to go box). I ordered the fish cakes for appetizer- it was good. I ordered the oxtails with rice and beans and cabbage - it was not good. When it came out, it looked overcooked.  The meat was tender, but the taste was awful  - the food had no flavor and the meat had a funny taste to it - like it was cleaned with dishwashing soap. I could not eat it. I then just ordered the sweet potato cheesecake- that was good. Well, apparently what I did eat of the oxtails gave me food poisoning.  Around midnight that night I was vomiting off and on the food til that morning with diarrhea!  I can not nor will I visit that establishment again!",

Their meat and seafood cases are always packed with deliciousness. Try their steak tips on the grill, you will fall in love! They also sell side dishes that are great for when you need to put together a quick dinner. Need ice cream? They've got it. Fresh mushrooms and vegetables? They have them! Freshly made sushi rolls? YES! Frozen fried onion rings? Yup, they have them! Plus wine and beer, a Starbucks outpost for everyone the needs their SB hit from time to time, plus they carry so many local products like MV Sea Salt and Val Cakes desserts and Not Your Sugar Mamas coffee.

Note... they do offer free water, I didn't notice until after I had bought a water. Make sure you grab a cookie, the size of your head, before you head out! My pick lemon sugar!!

We heard many times how \"...this brings back so many memories of how we used to do these on the beach when we were kids.\"  The staff was perfectly attentive and the amount of food for the price left a smile on the face of my family.

The atmosphere is cozy and comfortable yet upscale. In the fall/winter it's a special treat to sit near the roaring fireplace.  Service is professional, quick and attentive.   Large and appealing wine list.  Our most recent visit was in the shoulder season (Oct).  Nice bottle of Pouilly-Fuisse to start. Simply Roasted Carrots and PEI Mussels were the highlight starters along with the Bread Board.  Stand out mains were the Cast Iron Seared Scallops (butternut sq puree, spinach, quinoa, green apple, cilantro, sesame, yuzu vinaigrette) and the Grilled Swordfish (carrot-ginger mash, broccoli rabe, fennel cilantro blood orange  salad and black eyed peas).  Affogato all around for dessert, though from past experience we know the Olive Oil Cake and Chocolate Terrine and both excellent as well.  State Road is one if the best restaurants on the island.  Highly recommend.  Expensive by MV standards, yet not the most expensive on the island.  Our meal was worth the price.",

    "text": "We are so excited to finally have year-round Indian cuisine on the Island! We visited Indigo just a few days after they opened (August 2025), and they did not disappoint. Our favorites on the menu were the Madrasi chicken, the Goan shrimp curry, and the cheese naan. All were bursting with incredible flavor.\n\nWe also enjoyed the OG Butter Chicken; the sauce was rich and delicious, though we’d love to see a bit more protein in the portion to balance the sauce-to-protein ratio. Given that we visited within their first week of opening, we imagine they’re still fine-tuning some of the details, and it certainly didn’t take away from how tasty the dish was and we’d happily order it again.\n\nOne area that could improve was the speed of service. From placing our order to receiving the food, and when waiting for the check, the pace was slower than ideal - we waited about ~40 minutes for our dishes. It felt like the team is still getting into their rhythm, which is understandable for a brand-new restaurant.\n\nOverall, Indigo is a fantastic addition to the Edgartown dining scene, and we’re looking forward to many more flavorful meals here!",

    "text": "The food is extremely hot spicy. We asked for mild food, and we could not eat it. When we told the manager that we had ordered mild but couldn't eat it because because it was too hot spicy for us, he took about 30 minutes to let us know that Indian food couldn't be milder. We have eaten in other Indian restaurants. They modify the food to suit palates that can't tolerate hot spices. So we are never eating there again. Hopefully, the vineyard opens an Indian restaurant that can accommodate those of us that like spicy food without having tears coming out of our eyes because of how hot spicy it is.",

I requested tea and then asked if i could just have hot water with lemon. Kind of ridiculous that a pot of water cant be boiled. The oysters were the highlight. Mussels puttanesca was salty.

Everything g was seasoned well and super flavorful. The portions were so bug I had leftovers for the next day.  the Our waiter was incredible - friendly, accommodating, attentive and took the best pics of our group with the birthday girl. What shocked me most is how friendly the other patrons were. They asked if they could watch our stuff while we took pics, one senior lady offered to take our when we were waiting on our waiter to come back, and another older man ran after us when we went in another room for our pic to make sure we weren't forgetting our things at the table.",

The standouts for me were definitely the drinks, the Hot and Cold Lobster Rolls and the Steak Au Poivre of which all were incredibly flavorful and satisfying. The Attic Wings had just the right amount of kick, the Beets were cooked to perfection, rich and well-seasoned and the Lobster Corn Fritters were packed with flavored and served with a nice size of lump lobster.\nHowever, I thought the side of mashed potatoes did lacked flavor and texture, and the Tuna Tartar didn’t quite live up to expectations and wish there had been more avocado to help balance the taste. The rice was not prepared completely. Overall, the good definitely outweighed the bad.\nThe atmosphere was relaxed and welcoming, making it a great spot to unwind and enjoy good food with friends/family. The laid-back vibe, along with the service of Anthony the bartender (definitely ask for him to make your drinks) and Lobster rolls and Steak Au Poivre , makes The Attic Restaurant a place I’ll definitely be returning to.",

It's a pity a physically challenged person might miss out on the delights of the restaurant. I'm handicapped myself and could barely manage so felt it important to mention.",

The pizza was a cracker (honest to god a 0/10 pizza), the salad was wildly overdressed, and the cheese dip that came with the cauliflower was borderline inedible.\n\nI’m sure the seafood is a safe bet, but if anyone in your party is looking for non-seafood options I can’t recommend this place.",

The staff are warm, personable, and fun to be with.Very homey and family oriented with a Brazilian flare. The calamari appetizer was both delicious and plentiful, no skimping on the portion or the flavor!!!! This place is an Edgartown gem, and a much improved upgrade over the previous Square Rigger.

The sauce was deep, rich and well executed. The big boxy bread was a treat - and the butter a perfect herb infused compliment.\n\nThe fish and chips, a staple, had an excellent batter, but for nearly $50, was a bit of a eye watering price for two pieces of fried fish on a bed of fries. The fish that night, in an iridescent green broth, looked divine, but it was thin and rather bland. I heard the duck was well done, but didn't taste it.\n\nIn general, if you come here, the service will be great, the prices astronomical, and the food overall solid to very good, the prices knock this down to a B overall.",

The dining room was pretty sparsely populated when we arrived but both the main dining room and the outdoor patio had filled up by the time we left at 6:45.\n\nSince it’s BYOB, we brought a bottle of wine and a bottle of batched Negronis which our waitress quickly brought out glasses for and served. For dinner we started with the bread, special cheese starter and summer squash. I thought that the squash was really exceptional. For my main course I ordered the half chicken. It came with a side salad and was crispy, juicy and delicious. Two of my girlfriends got the chicken pot pie and said it was one of the best they ever had. The Buffalo Brussels were also on point.\n\nThe food here felt like having a great home cooked meal. Looking forward to coming back!",

Mike guided me to that.\nEasy parking. Walked in the door. Great decorations. Clean and stylish. They even have a pancake machine.\nThe buffet was a bit small but had more than enough to fill our plates. Our table was a bit wobbly.\nThe service was great. Its new. Room for improvement.  I look forward to our next visit.",

Let’s start with the fries — so crispy, so golden, so delectable they honestly might’ve changed our lives. Easily the star of the table and not just an afterthought side.\n\nThe service? Incredible. Attentive and kind without ever hovering — they struck the perfect balance between friendly and chill. Even the water was a highlight: icy, crisp, and self-serve (which we loved).\n\nWe ordered a lot (the portions were huge) but were pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to box things up to bring home — it was all so filling in the best way. The Greek salad was fresh, flavorful, and everything you want from a salad. And the buffalo chicken wrap? Absolutely hit the spot — packed with flavor and paired with amazing sides.\n\nThe atmosphere was its own kind of magic — bustly, coastal, and the perfect blend of casual and classy. The place had such a welcoming, cultural vibe — families, friends, reunions, locals, and tourists all mixed in together. The menu had so many diverse options, it felt like everyone could find something they loved.\n\nAll in all? Nancy’s nailed it. The food, the vibe, the service — everything. Couldn’t have asked for a better meal or a better place to spend our evening.\nFive out of five. Would go again in a heartbeat.",

The food and cocktails are pricy which leaves you with the expectation for an amazing culinary journey. Cassoulet is delicious but overwhelming in size. Best to be mindful of all the mains being oversized when ordering. It's a nice treat when on the Vineyard.",

    "text": "The decor is lovely. The chef hit it out of the park on flavors, Five Stars. Wines by the glass were terrific. The mezze appetizer could not have been better. But that’s where the good news ended. A restaurant that is always changing its menu runs a risk, the same way that specials at a restaurant are not always as good as the tried and true. It must be difficult for the kitchen at The Ocean Club with all their changing up.\nPoint in fact, the lasagna bolognese was so dry it may have been the worst thing I have ever ordered. Tasted great flavor wise and the filling would have been nice on pasta (think meaty bolognese that runs on the dry side, clinging to rigatoni), but honestly I could not cut it thin enough to eat and the sparse amount of yummy sauce on the plate that I dipped it in soon ran out. The half duck that (per our server)  took days to prepare had a sauce with a delectable flavor, but the meat was oddly grey and mushy. Maybe cooked too long via sous vide or other method?\nI hope they decide to land on a few tried and true menu items, and if they want to get creative, vary the sauce seasonings or sub out an ingredient here and there. Not major shifting like they are doing. Or better yet, leave a core set of selections alone and don’t mess with perfection.",

I may have, no I DID, have the best meal I've had in years on the Island at the Maker MV and we couldn't have been treated better.\n\nI have a garlic allergy and not only was the restaurant responsive to my questions ahead of time (as the smell is a factor too), when I arrived they shared a list of dishes I COULD enjoy with my family - and some, where I'd have to ask for a substitution on an ingredient. Talk about 10/10 service!\n\nWe had a freshly made starter - a ficaccia bread 'starter\" with olive oil  - while it looked amazing, they did forewarn me that it had garlic so I had to pass. My family loved it.\n\nFor dinner, I ordered the Lumache and was in lemon heaven. This freshly made pasta dish did not disappoint. The sauce was a perfect balance, not overwelming or overly sauced, and I loved the nutty chunch of the toasted pangrattato. My family ordered the new to the menu that night, Halibut, and a menu staple, Bucatiti.  All were perfection and not a scrap left on the dish as you can see.  I'm still dreaming about the Lumache!\n\nFor dessert I finally got the GBB show dessert of my dreams a Strawberry Pavlova - I swear there was a hint of coconut and maybe mango? It was a sweet crunchy blissful ending to a perfect night.\n\nNote they don't yet have their liquor license so there was BYOB but we didn't miss a thing with soda, water and other beverages. They even have my favorite soda Something & Nothing's Rose & Hibiscus.\n\nTruly Sheenagh and Chef Carlos have nailed it and this is a spot YOU MUST STOP IN this summer - or fall or winter. I hear the plan is to stay open all-year long too! I can't wait to go back. Just remember to call ahead for reservations! They do sell out.\n\nTHANK YOU for taking such good care of me and advising what I could order - no other resturant has done that so well. Kudos!",

They seated us around 5 minutes after we checked in and though we placed drink orders right away they did take a fair amount of time to come out.\n\nThe restaurant was fairly crowded and our waitress seemed a bit overwhelmed. Our oysters didn’t come out for half an hour, non-raw apps 45 minutes and our main courses didn’t hit the table for almost 90 minutes.\n\nThe oysters were fresh and we really enjoyed the summer succotash, stuffed quahogs and cornbread. For my main I had the Miso Tofu which was ok. It could have been spicier and the inclusion of corn ribs hiding in the curry felt like a mistake because I thought I had somehow found a bone in my curry. My husband liked the scallops he ordered but I had friends that didn’t love the linguine and salmon. Rave reviews for the lobster dinner though.\n\nOverall it was a pretty uneven meal but the view and location are dynamite.",

I had a hard time choosing but the server gave excellent feedback and guidance.\n\nI wish I had taken more photos of the food but we were so immersed in an all around enjoyable dining experience. Capturing it digitally was an after thought.\nAs a table, we shared a shrimp cocktail and cornbread. The shrimp was big and tasted so fresh. The cornbread was perfect and gave me a teaser to the stuffing in the quahog I ordered. 🤤\n\n•Our first courses included a beautifully balanced watermelon salad and the buttery and savory flavors in the stuffed quahog. 🤌🏽\n•Second courses included the steak, scallops, swordfish and fried fluke. All 5⭐️ dishes. I was lucky to taste test the others.\nScallops were tender and perfectly cooked, the swordfish was the best I’ve ever tasted, the steak was excellent if you’re not feeling seafood and I was really surprised by my entree, the fried fluke. Their spin on fish and chips…the onion rings were buttery crisp delicious and the fish had a different breading that was light, filling but not heavy and the Coleslaw was tasty.\nIt’s a dry town. BYOB is a nice option. They put our bottle on ice and gave use glassware.\n•Dessert selected was key lime pie, blueberry cobbler served in a cute mason jar, and they were out of the strawberry rhubarb pie but they did have a peach pie option served with ice cream\n\nI highly recommend.\nWe got a little dressy celebrating a birthday but it’s casual dining. Indoors and out on the deck. Oyster bar outside as well. Great atmosphere and great music gave a light and fun vibe. I’d love to return.",

The host was kind, welcoming, and accommodating. I’m so glad we made the trip—what a wonderful experience from start to finish!",

Not to worry though We grabbed some snacks, coffee, and shopped a bit at all the other Black Dog spots until we were able to be seated at 12:30 with a bunch of other families who were all also waiting to eat. Atmosphere inside is great and you can’t beat the nostalgia factor. Crab spinach and artichoke dip was incredibly good. The lobster rolls were the best we’ve had yet in the Cape Cod area (although the coleslaw left something to be desired). Caesar salad was pretty standard and the crab cakes were just ok. The sauce and corn was good but the crab cakes were too thin and too fried for my taste. The presentation also could use some work.\n\nOther than the service not being the greatest and the unkind hostess, we had a lovely time with beautiful views and tasty food!",

    "text": "I brought my family here for lunch for nostalgia as they’d never been & have heard me speak of the Black Dog for many years. Unfortunately it was during the 1st heat wave of the year. Hoping to catch some relief from the heat when we went inside, we were very disappointed to find they had all the windows open and no air conditioning on. I was literally sweating from head to toe. No breeze today. Not even a fan for some relief for those sitting by the opened windows.\nThe waitress was very polite and professional. Her speed was appreciated. We ordered the Cobb Salad with Grilled Chicken, the Shrimp Fra Diavolo, and they special-made a Grilled Cheese sandwich. The food was served in small portion size. The shrimp pasta was a bit spicy for my hubby, but he did eat the whole thing. I would have liked more greens on my plate but it was delicious. My daughter thought the Grilled cheese and sides were delicious. We found we were still hungry only a couple hours afterwards. I believe they’re overpriced for what we received; mainly paying for the brand rather than the food. We probably won’t be returning and really don’t recommend if you’re really hungry.",

The baffling part is when you go in they see to not be busy in the height of summer for a reason... too much has changed in a negative direction... Disappointing, underwhelming salads and lukewarm food. Theirs pizzas were the biggest (soggy) letdown of all- and we only ordered cheese so it wasn't the toppings fault. Also really overpriced.",

Every bite was tasty, soft, and flavorful, but the apple fritters really stood out—warm, perfectly spiced, and generously portioned.\n\nIt was such a fun and memorable experience, and you can really tell these are made fresh with care. Whether you’re looking for a sweet morning treat or just want to experience a Martha’s Vineyard staple, this is a spot not to miss. We’ll definitely be back for more fritters and donuts next time!",

Luckily the line was short but they were out several of the most popular flavors, although they still had apple fritters.\n\nThis spot is literally operated out of the back door of the business, inside of the parking lot. It's nothing fancy but it's definitely a cool vibe and a novel idea. Flavors we tried: Honey dipped, cinnamon, buttermilk and the infamous apple fritter. The honey dipped tasted like a regular glazed donut - nothing unique. The cinnamon was good, and so was the buttermilk. The apple fritter received good reviews. I plan to return to try other flavors. Overall everything was good and I recommend this place.",

We were four , we had 2 swordfish, one halibut and one lobster.  Those mains were very average. I was so looking forward to getting a halibut; the piece was small and dry ;lacked flavor. It was served on some cherry tomatoes, with a dressing and lobster meat, again there was clearly something missing.\nMy friends also were disappointed by their entrees.\nInsance prices, including for the drinks; like a 22$ plus for.a martini, 7 $ for the bread. It’s a very expensive place but the food does not match unfortunately.",

We weren’t planning on sitting down, but after the owner greeted us and told us about their BBQ Wednesdays, we decided to grab a seat—and we’re so glad we did. We had a beer, the basket of fries, and the coconut shrimp… which my girlfriend said was the best she’s ever had. She swore she can never eat coconut shrimp again unless it’s from Coop de Ville.\n\nOur server, who was originally from Jamaica, was incredibly kind and welcoming, and the whole vibe was just unmatched—great reggae music, amazing views of the Oak Bluffs harbor, and a laid-back energy that made us want to stay for hours.\n\nThe owner mentioned he’s been running the place for 30+ years, and you can feel the love and history in every corner. We’ll be back every year we visit the island. Absolutely recommend stopping by if you’re anywhere near Oak Bluffs. 🌴🍤🍻",

I have a high heat tolerance so it was not too spicy for me personally, but it truly enhanced the dish.  It was bursting with flavor.

Yes, the view of Edgartown Harbor is breathtaking — the kind that glows in the golden light of Martha’s Vineyard — but here, it’s the food that truly steals the show.\n\nUnder the remarkable leadership of Executive Chef Juan Martinez and Sous Chef Momo Camara, every plate is crafted with soul and precision. The scallop crudo was a masterpiece of restraint — impossibly fresh, delicate, kissed with just the right acidity to let the sea speak for itself. The lobster bucatini came next, beautifully balanced with a subtle kick that added warmth without overwhelming the sweet richness of the lobster. And then, the beef carpaccio — paper-thin, melt-in-your-mouth tender, and bursting with flavor in every bite.\n\nService was flawless from start to finish. Our bartender Taylor made the most beautiful hot cocoa for my daughter — just the right temperature, velvety, and not too hot — proof of the team’s thoughtful attention to detail. Andrei, our server, was both attentive and genuinely funny, effortlessly remembering each of my kids’ names after our very first dinner. That kind of personal touch transforms a meal into a memory.\n\nBettini isn’t just a hotel restaurant — it’s a culinary destination in its own right. Whether you come for the harbor views, the impeccable service, or the artistry on your plate, you’ll leave knowing you’ve just experienced something special.",

What the team at Bettini did for me moved me to tears. When I sat down, they handed me a personalized menu created in honor of my mom. It was such a thoughtful and unexpected gesture. They even told me I could take the menu home, which I will treasure forever.\n\nThe food was absolutely amazing, every bite was perfect. To top it all off, they brought out a beautiful birthday dessert with a chocolate “Happy Birthday” plaque and a tall candle. It felt like they celebrated her with me.\n\nTo say I had an amazing time would be an understatement. Bettini is not just a restaurant — it's a place that touches your heart.

We were celebrating my friend's new job in LA, so we wanted somewhere we could feel extra special celebrating.\n\nSitting at the bar was the perfect choice — the atmosphere was welcoming, the conversation flowed easily, and the bartenders professionalism truly stood out. Hunter crafted what was hands down the best espresso martini we’ve ever had, setting the tone for a fantastic evening. Taylor made us one of the signature cocktails of Bettini as well and truly - another five star drink to start the night. The ambiance at Bettini strikes a perfect balance between elegant and inviting, making it an ideal spot for a relaxed yet elevated night out.\n\nThe food was equally impressive. We started with the beef skewers, which were incredibly tender, and the shrimp empanadas, which were perfectly crisp and flavorful. The gnocchi with wild mushrooms and truffle was a standout — rich, decadent, and absolutely delicious. The chicken dish was spectacular, beautifully cooked and full of flavor. We ended on a sweet note with the chocolate torte, a lovely finish to an unforgettable meal. If you're visiting Edgartown, a meal at Bettini is a must and we highly recommend grabbing a seat at the bar — between the amazing service, exquisite food, and lively ambiance, it’s an experience you won’t want to miss. Taylor and Hunter are true professionals and we look forward to coming in again and telling all our friends about our experience!",

    "text": "Amazing Oysters & Laid-Back Island Vibes\n\nOur first attempt to visit Nomans was on a Friday night—unknowingly right when it seemed like everyone on the island had the same idea! We decided to try again on Saturday afternoon, and I’m so glad we did. The vibes were still popping, but without the long wait.\n\nMolly, the bartender, was fantastic—friendly, welcoming, and pouring some truly delicious drinks. We enjoyed a couple of Mai Tais and a strong Old Fashioned before diving into the main event: the oysters. And let me tell you… these were AH-mazing—so fresh, so tasty, just downright guuud! We started with a half dozen, but they were so good we had to order another half dozen. I can honestly say these are probably the best oysters I’ve had to date.\n\nOur kids enjoyed playing a few games while we relaxed, and we also tried the cod sandwich—perfectly cooked, with a flavorful aioli that really stood out. The fries were fresh, hot, and tasty. The music (not live) added to the already chill, island vibe, making it even easier to kick back and enjoy the afternoon.\n\nI’m so glad our plans shifted to Saturday instead of Friday—it made for the perfect, laid-back island experience. We’ll definitely be back!",

Seating was limited so we had to stand for a bit before we were able to find a place to sit.\n\nThere were reserved sections on the patio and out on the lawn. We eventually found seats with a table and ordered appetizers and drinks. There was a couple of corn hole games outside which kept some of the children that were present, occupied.  The DJ played a variety of music that kept everyone on the dance floor. A good time was had.",

My parents and I stopped by this store while exploring the area and ordered 3 slices of pizza and 2 cups of hot tea. The pizza slices seemed old and the crust was tough—maybe a whole fresh pizza would’ve been better.\nAfter a long day of walking, we asked for a simple refill of hot water for our tea cups. A young staff member was initially willing, but after a word from an older woman (likely the manager), she told us they don’t do tea refills. I asked if we could pay for just hot water, and after some hesitation, the young staff member kindly gave us the refill without charge.\n\nI appreciated her willingness to help, but I was disappointed by the manager’s refusal—especially since it was just hot water for my 80-year-old dad. A little kindness goes a long way. I hope she would not treat other old people this way.",

Also a great farm stand to pick up beach food - they have everything from a delicious salad bar to baked goods, cheeses, crackers, charcuterie, and so much more. Need peanut butter? They grind their own and it comes in a glass jar (yei no plastic!); need flowers for a dinner, they have them; want some beach plum jam, they make their own -  also their strawberry jam is amazing! Plus they have ready. to eat dinners like tacos, meatloaf, macaroni and cheese, and so much more, easy to reheat when you're on the go. Morning Glory Farm - definitely a favorite on island!",

Wonderful views over the harbor and you can watch the Chappy ferry on its constant back and forth journey. Service was good. The lobster roll was served with fries and had lots of chunk lobster – seemed to be a good value.  The Clam Chowder had a good flavor and was very creamy.  The fried shrimp platter was okay, but seemed a bit overpriced for the amount of shrimp. The winner was the lobster dip appetizer, served with lots of crispy pita bread. We also loved the Ocean Berry Booze cocktail. Would go back for the dip, cocktail and the great views. Outside seating was very full when we left around 7:30 pm.",

The flavor was very strong and savory, like a winter beef stew. The cavatelli was lightly baked which gave it a nice crunch.\nMy wife ordered the veal Parmesan and it was cooked to perfection. The plate it was served on was the size of a pizza lol.

I asked one of the staff if they could remake the order for the eggs to be runny and they immediately followed through with kindness.

    "text": "Perfect Kickoff to Our Martha’s Vineyard Stay\n\nLookout Tavern was the very first restaurant we visited when we arrived on the island, and it set the tone for a fantastic trip. Our party of six enjoyed a total of four (maybe five!) warm lobster rolls, one shrimp platter, four rum punches, and one or two lemonades—and everything was fresh, flavorful, and delicious. The lobster rolls were especially memorable—tender lobster meat, perfectly seasoned, and served warm.\n\nBefore our meals arrived, we shared calamari and fried oysters as appetizers, and both were absolutely delicious—crispy, well-seasoned, and the perfect way to start the meal.\n\nWhen we arrived, we were told the wait might be around 30 minutes, but in reality, it was only about 10. That gave us just enough time to take a quick walk across the pier and enjoy the view before being seated. We were placed at a comfortable picnic table with a great view of the lively scene around us—people enjoying good food, great weather, and relaxed island vibes.\n\nThe service was friendly, the food came out quickly, and the overall atmosphere made for the perfect kickoff to our stay on the Vineyard. We will absolutely be back on our next visit—especially for those lobster rolls!",

The sandwich just didn’t taste right. Another member of my party ordered a burger well done and it still had some pink in it. Finally, the house salad that came with the burger was inedible due to the balsamic dressing that was served, that was like sludge. Not a great spot especially for the price!!",

Huge portions, excellent flavors, great menu selections, and super friendly staff. No tables to eat at inside, take out only, but the sea wall out front offers a million dollar view and seating option. This is real people food.

A parking lot serves this pizzeria among other businesses, and has bathrooms that close in the mid afternoon. The lot has plenty of parking spaces much of the time, but on busy ferry days (probably summer weekends) spaces are scarce.

The hostess and staff were friendly and professional, making the evening even more enjoyable.\n\nI began my meal with the pan-seared, spice-crusted fresh La Belle Farm duck foie gras, which was honestly the best foie gras I've ever tasted. The charred factor added a unique twist, enhancing the flavor without overpowering the delicate texture, allowing the foie gras to still melt in your mouth.\n\nFor the entrée, I chose the étuvée of 1 1/2-pound Menemsha lobster, a dish bursting with flavor. The sauce, highlighted by roasted garlic, truly made the lobster shine. To finish, I enjoyed an espresso martini, one of the best I've had in a long time. This version used chocolate liquor, offering a delightful twist on the classic drink.\n\nWhile I wasn't a fan of the \"Matcha My Freak\" and \"Whistle While You Work\" cocktails, I suspect it was more due to my personal taste preferences. Despite this, I am eager to return and try other drinks on the menu.\n\nOverall, L’étoile Restaurant is a fantastic location for an elegant dining experience. I highly recommend it for those seeking a sophisticated meal in a picturesque setting.",

    "text": "My Wife and I had an amazing dining experience at L'Etoile from the moment we arrived to good bye!  We ate out in the front yard which made all the difference.   The lawn dining area / open tent is close enough to the street to see people go by but not too close for comfort.  The garden area as you walk in was in peak bloom.  It was a cool summer night with soft blues playing from a bar close by.   We had Oysters Two-Styles.  I Never had an oyster with cream in the shell, very good and std vinegar type. Excellent.  The Menemsha Lobster was prepared perfectly and so was the Rack of  Lamb Chops.   I would go back in a heartbeat but it took months to get a reservation.  Cost for dinner and drinks for two was $213 + tip.   A real night to remember.",

    "text": "My husband and I had dinner at l'etoile for our wedding anniversary and we're impressed by the restaurant's ambience, food, and level of service.\n\nFood:\n- Braised short ribs ($22) were delicious but it was the maple-smoked cheddar polenta that temped us to lick the plate clean\n- Lamb chop ($52) was delicious, no gamey-ness at all. The accompanying spinach and roast tomato grape leaf tartlet seemed random but was very tasty!\n- Lobster ($68) was delicious, as was the pasta. That said, this entree was spendy.\n\nAmbience:\nLike many businesses in Edgartown, this restaurant is in a house, with seating on the front lawn on Adirondack chairs, inside in tastefully renovated rooms with mood lighting, or outside under a semi-permanent tent that still has tables dressed with white tablecloths and decorated as tastefully as the restaurant's indoor dining tables.\n\nService:\nThe staff were very friendly, attentive, well-trained, quick with the water refills, and not too stuffy or pompous. We felt very welcome!\n\nParking:\nStreet parking only, which can be hard to come by in the area, even during the off season.",
