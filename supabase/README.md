## How to Use

### Adding New Schema
1. Create file in `schema/` (e.g., `add-new-feature-table.sql`)
2. Run in Supabase SQL Editor
3. File stays in `schema/` for reference

### Adding New Functions
1. Create file in `functions/`
2. Run in Supabase SQL Editor
3. Functions can be re-run safely (CREATE OR REPLACE)

### Adding RLS Policies
1. Create file in `policies/`
2. Run in Supabase SQL Editor
3. Document what the policy protects

### Adding Indexes
1. Create file in `indexes/`
2. Use `IF NOT EXISTS` so it's safe to re-run
3. Run in Supabase SQL Editor

### One-Time Migrations
1. Create file in `migrations/applied/` with date prefix
2. Run in Supabase SQL Editor
3. Never run again (data changes, fixes, etc.)
