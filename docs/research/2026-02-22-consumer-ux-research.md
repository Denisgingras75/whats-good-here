# Consumer UX Research: What WGH Can Learn From the Best Rating Apps

**Date:** February 22, 2026
**Scope:** Untappd, Letterboxd, Yelp, TripAdvisor, Google Maps, Vivino, The Infatuation, Eater, Goodreads, Beli, Spotify Wrapped
**Purpose:** Understand what makes rating apps sticky, what design choices drive engagement, and what WGH should steal, adapt, or reject.

---

## The One-Sentence Thesis

**The best rating apps turn a utility ("find something good") into an identity ("I'm someone who knows what's good").**

Every design choice below serves or undermines that transformation.

---

## 1. THE PSYCHOLOGICAL HOOKS: Why People Rate Things

Three motivations, in order of power:

| Motivation | Hook | Who It Serves | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Utility** | "Rate things, get better recs" | Browsers | Vivino: rate 5 wines, get "Match for You" |
| **Identity** | "My ratings say who I am" | Pioneers | Letterboxd: four favorite films on profile |
| **Social** | "See what friends think" | Network effects | Untappd: activity feed of friends' check-ins |

Most apps lean on utility and wonder why retention is low. The apps people LOVE lean on identity. **The shift from USE to LOVE happens when the app becomes part of how you see yourself.**

### What This Means for WGH

The Bite Slider is utility. "Your Top 4 Dishes" on your profile is identity. "Sarah just rated the lobster roll 9.2" is social. WGH needs all three layers, but **identity is the retention layer** that separates WGH from Google Maps.

---

## 2. THE RATING SYSTEMS COMPARED

| App | Scale | Input | Feel |
|---|---|---|---|
| Yelp | 1-5 stars | Tap | Judgment. Reviewing a restaurant. |
| Google Maps | 1-5 stars | Tap | Quick. Barely thinking. |
| TripAdvisor | 1-5 bubbles | Tap + subcategories | Thorough. Planning mode. |
| Untappd | 0-5 (0.25 steps) | Slider | Logging. "I tried this." |
| Letterboxd | 0.5-5 (half stars) | Tap | Declaration. "This is my taste." |
| Vivino | 1-5 (decimal) | Slider | Investment. "Better recs for me." |
| The Infatuation | 1-10 (decimal) | Editorial | Authority. "Trust us." |
| **WGH** | **1-10 (decimal)** | **Slider** | **Should feel: "Would I order this again?"** |

### Key Insights

**Star compression kills signal.** Yelp's meaningful range is 3.5-4.5 (one star of differentiation). Google is worse — everything is 4.0-4.8. WGH's 1-10 scale with the Consensus Engine percentage avoids this entirely. "92% would order again" communicates more than "4.3 stars" ever can.

**Untappd's genius: rating is optional.** The check-in IS the action. Rating is bonus. This removes all friction. For WGH, the minimum viable interaction should be "Would you order this again? Yes/No" — the Bite Slider is the premium layer on top.

**Letterboxd separates "rate" from "like."** Stars = quality. Heart = personal connection. A film can be 2.5 stars but hearted because it meant something. WGH could have the Bite Slider (quality) + "My comfort food" or a personal save (connection) as distinct signals.

---

## 3. THE COLOR PSYCHOLOGY

| App | Signature Color | What It Communicates |
|---|---|---|
| Yelp | Red (#FF1A1A) | Urgency, warning. Feels corporate, not food. |
| Letterboxd | Green (#00E054) / Orange (#FF8000) / Blue (#40BCF4) | Three colors, three verbs, three emotional states. Cinema. |
| Untappd | Amber/beer yellow | Warmth. Literally the color of beer. Perfect theming. |
| Vivino | Burgundy/wine red | Dynamic gradients match the wine type. The content IS the color. |
| TripAdvisor | Fluorescent green (#00AF87) | Authority. Encyclopedia. Trust. |
| Google Maps | Blue/white | Utility. Tool. Directions. |
| The Infatuation | Signature blue + neon | "We are different from every food app." Trust + energy. |

### The Letterboxd Lesson: Three Colors, Three Meanings

Letterboxd's most brilliant design choice: **green = watched/rated, orange = hearted/loved, blue = want to see.** Three colors. Three verbs. Three emotional states. Every interaction maps to one color. You can read an entire page's state from color alone.

### What This Means for WGH

Your gold (#D9A765) is your signature — warmth, quality, appetite. It's as perfect for food as Untappd's amber is for beer. But you need a complete semantic color system:

- **Gold** = Rated / quality / "the answer" (your primary accent)
- **Coral/Primary (#E45A35)** = Action / CTA / "do this now"
- **Rating green (#16A34A / #6BB384)** = Score / consensus / "how good"

The constraint is what makes it feel premium. Resist adding more colors. Three is enough.

---

## 4. WHAT MAKES APPS FEEL PREMIUM VS. GENERIC

### Letterboxd's Formula (the gold standard):

1. **Dark theme as default.** Film posters glow against darkness. Food photos would too.
2. **Content IS the decoration.** Movie posters are the UI. For WGH, dish photos are the UI.
3. **Constrained color palette.** Three semantic colors, not a rainbow.
4. **Two-font system.** One for UI (Graphik), one for editorial (Tiempos). WGH has Aglet Sans (brand) + DM Sans (everything else) — this is right.
5. **Imagery does heavy lifting.** Browse is a visual gallery, not a text list.

### The Infatuation's Formula:

1. **One typeface (National 2) used relentlessly.** Consistency across every touchpoint compounds into trust.
2. **Blue as a food brand color** — unusual, therefore memorable.
3. **Photography style: close-up, high-saturation, no overhead flat-lays.** Everything looks like you're sitting at the table reaching for it.
4. **Opinionated voice.** Not neutral aggregation — verdicts.

### What WGH Should Do:

Your Island Depths (dark) theme should make food photos GLOW. The warm gold accent against deep navy is already cinematic. Consider making Island Depths the default for evening browsing (auto-switch after 6PM?). The food photo grid should feel like browsing a curated gallery, not scrolling a database.

---

## 5. GAMIFICATION: THE BADGE MACHINE

### Untappd's System (the most sophisticated):

- **~15,000 badges** across beer styles, venues, events, milestones, seasons
- **Multi-level progression** — badges have levels (1 through 100+), not just unlock/don't-unlock
- **Business-created badges** — bars create loyalty badges ("Drink 5 beers here, get a free glass")
- **Push notifications** — "You're 2 beers away from Level 5 of Hop Head!"
- **The insight: logging feels like PLAYING.** Every check-in is a game move.

### Letterboxd's Approach (subtler):

- **Four Favorites** — pick your four, display on profile. People agonize over this.
- **Diary** — chronological log becomes a personal artifact over time.
- **Stats** — viewing habits broken down by decade, genre, country. Shareable.
- **Year in Review** — Wrapped-style annual recap.

### WGH Badge Ideas (Start with 20-30, not 15,000):

**Exploration:**
- "Island Explorer" — rate dishes at 10 different MV restaurants
- "Seafood Scholar" — rate 20 seafood dishes
- "Town Hopper" — rate dishes in 4+ different towns

**Pioneer:**
- "First Bite" — be the first real person to rate a dish
- "Local Legend" — rate 50 dishes on Martha's Vineyard
- "Menu Master" — rate 5+ dishes at the same restaurant
- "Tastemaker" — 3 of your ratings matched the eventual consensus

**Seasonal/Limited:**
- "Summer 2026 Pioneer" — limited edition for launch summer
- "Memorial Day Foodie" — rate a dish during opening weekend
- "Sunset Voter" — rate a dish after 7PM (fun, not useful)

**Business-Created (future revenue):**
- "Lookout Tavern Regular" — rate 5 dishes, unlock... bragging rights? Future: actual deal

**Critical: Don't reward volume, reward exploration.** Untappd got criticism for encouraging overconsumption. WGH should reward trying different things, not eating 50 lobster rolls.

---

## 6. LISTS & DISCOVERY

### How the Best Apps Handle Curation:

| App | List Format | Why It Works |
|---|---|---|
| Letterboxd | User-created + editorial "Featured Lists" | Lists are conversation starters. Numbered = debate. |
| The Infatuation | "The 25 Best..." with rankings | Opinionated, numbered, locally specific. Shareable. |
| Eater | "The 38 Essential" + Heatmaps | Number (38) is large enough to feel comprehensive, small enough to feel curated. Updated regularly. |
| Vivino | "Top Rated" by style/region | Algorithmically generated but feels editorial. |

### WGH's 6 Killer Lists Are Exactly Right

Your seeded lists (Best Lobster Rolls, Best Seafood, etc.) map directly to The Infatuation's model. The key additions from this research:

1. **Number them.** "#1 Lobster Roll on Martha's Vineyard" is a conversation starter. "Top Lobster Rolls" is a search result.
2. **Update them visibly.** "Updated weekly" creates return visits. Static lists die.
3. **Let Pioneers create personal lists.** "My Vineyard Favorites" becomes social currency. A tourist sharing their MV eating list on Instagram is free marketing.
4. **The Eater Heatmap concept.** "Trending This Week" map view — what's getting the most new high ratings right now? This is your Hub page's data, visualized spatially.

---

## 7. SOCIAL FEATURES THAT ACTUALLY WORK

### The Activity Feed (Untappd, Letterboxd)

Both apps use the **friends activity feed as the home screen.** You open the app and immediately see people doing things. This creates:

- **Ambient awareness** — you know what your circle is eating/watching without anyone actively sharing
- **FOMO** — "Sarah tried a 9.2 lobster roll and I haven't been to that place yet"
- **The feeling of aliveness** — the app isn't a database, it's a room full of people

### Beli's Taste Similarity Score

Every friend has a **taste similarity percentage** relative to you. This means:
- You know whose recommendations to trust (high similarity = reliable)
- Disagreements become interesting conversations (low similarity on a specific dish = worth discussing)

### Letterboxd's "Almost Everything Is Logged"

When you rate, your followers see it. When you add to watchlist, they see it. When you like a review, they see it. This **ambient logging** makes the platform feel alive.

### WGH Social Priorities for Launch:

**Phase 1 (Memorial Day):** Aggregate social proof only. "12 ratings today." "Trending: Fish Tacos at Net Result." Tourists don't have social graphs on the island.

**Phase 2 (Mid-summer):** Pioneer activity feed. Let Pioneers follow each other. Show what local foodies are rating.

**Phase 3 (Post-summer):** Taste similarity. "You and @username agree on 78% of dishes." This is the retention hook for returning visitors.

---

## 8. THE REVIEW FORMAT SPECTRUM

| App | Default Review | Dominant Culture |
|---|---|---|
| Yelp | 447-char mini blog post | Performative — writing for status |
| TripAdvisor | 100-300 word narrative | Thorough — writing to inform |
| Google Maps | 1-2 sentences (or zero) | Minimal — tapping to help |
| Letterboxd | One-liner jokes to essays | Expressive — writing as entertainment |
| Untappd | Optional. Most are blank. | The check-in IS the contribution |
| The Infatuation | Editorial, opinionated | Authority — writing as a verdict |

### WGH's Position: The Bite Slider IS the Review

The single biggest structural advantage: **WGH needs voters, not writers.** A 2-second slide captures signal from the 95% of diners that Yelp never hears from.

For those who WANT to write: keep it tweet-length. "Crispy outside, melt-in-your-mouth inside, best on the island." The prompt should be "What stood out?" — not "Write a review." The existing tap-to-expand pattern is exactly right.

---

## 9. PHOTOGRAPHY: THE MAKE-OR-BREAK FACTOR

### What the Research Shows:

- **Letterboxd:** Film posters ARE the UI. The platform is gorgeous because its content is gorgeous.
- **The Infatuation:** Close-up, high-saturation, "reaching for it" food photography. Aspirational but accessible.
- **Untappd:** Beer label art provides a consistent visual anchor. Every beer has imagery.
- **TripAdvisor:** 2x engagement when restaurants have 10+ photos.
- **Yelp/Google:** Photo galleries are disorganized dumps. No dish-level organization.

### WGH's Photo Strategy:

1. **Every dish needs a hero photo.** AI-seeded dishes need decent stock/generated food imagery at launch. A dish card without an image is invisible.
2. **User photos attached to votes** become the real gallery. Your ReviewFlow already supports this.
3. **Organize photos BY DISH, not by restaurant.** This is something neither Yelp nor Google does well.
4. **The first good user photo replaces the placeholder.** Progression from placeholder → first user photo → best user photo should feel organic.
5. **The food photo grid should be as addictive as Letterboxd's poster grid.** On the Browse page, dish cards with mouth-watering photos drive taps. Make the grid large, 2-column, thumb-friendly.

## 10. WHAT YELP GETS WRONG (AND WGH SHOULD EXPLOIT)

| Yelp Problem | WGH Answer |
|---|---|
| Restaurant-level ratings hide dish quality | Dish-level is the atomic unit |
| 5-star compression (meaningful range: 3.5-4.5) | 1-10 decimal + Consensus % |
| Must write a paragraph to contribute | Slide once. Done. |
| "Should I eat here?" | "What should I order here?" |
| Search returns restaurants | Search returns ranked dishes |
| Elite gatekeeping (human approval) | Earned through activity, not cliques |
| Multi-category identity crisis (plumbers AND tacos) | Single purpose: food discovery |
| Competitor ads on restaurant pages | Clean, ad-free experience |
| Reviews from 2019 carry same weight as today | Recency-weighted, seasonal awareness |
| No "right now" signal | Hub page: "What's happening tonight" |
| Red-and-black corporate palette | Warm gold. Makes you hungry. |

**The fundamental gap:** Yelp built for WRITERS. WGH is built for VOTERS. The participation pool for "slide a number" is 100x larger than "write a paragraph."

---

## 11. THE SPOTIFY WRAPPED PLAYBOOK

Spotify Wrapped generated **500 million shares within 24 hours** in 2025. The psychology:

1. **Optimal Distinctiveness** — you belong (everyone does Wrapped) AND you're unique (your stats are yours alone)
2. **9:16 vertical cards** — designed for Instagram Stories first, not desktop
3. **Progressive reveal** — one stat at a time, building anticipation
4. **Comparison mechanics** — "top 1% of listeners" creates competitive sharing
5. **Scarcity** — once a year. The constraint creates anticipation.

### "Your Vineyard Summer" — WGH's Wrapped Moment

At Labor Day, generate for every user who rated 5+ dishes:

- "You rated 34 dishes at 12 restaurants this summer"
- "Your highest-rated dish: Lobster Roll at The Lookout (9.2)"
- "You're a Seafood Pioneer — 78% of your ratings were seafood"
- "You discovered 3 dishes before they hit the Top 10"
- "Your taste twin on the island: @username"
- "You agreed with the crowd 67% of the time" (conformist vs. contrarian signal)

**Cost: $0.** Purely frontend, reading existing data. The data already exists in the ratings table. This is the most cost-effective viral feature you can build.

---

## 12. THE COMPETITOR YOU SHOULD WATCH: BELI

Beli is the closest existing product to WGH. Exploding among Gen Z, especially on college campuses.

**What Beli does differently:**
- **Comparison-based rating** — instead of "rate this 1-10," it asks you to compare against your existing list. The algorithm assigns the score.
- **Taste similarity score** — every friend has a % match to your taste
- **No ads, no sponsored content, no algorithmic feed** — just friends' activity
- **Campus leaderboards** — students compete on their school's food ranking

**WGH advantages over Beli:**
- Beli rates RESTAURANTS, not dishes. WGH's dish-level granularity is a genuine differentiator.
- Beli requires an existing social graph. WGH works for tourists with zero connections.
- WGH has AI-seeded data from day one. Beli starts cold.

**What to steal from Beli:**
- The taste similarity score concept (Phase 3 feature)
- The zero-ad, trust-first ethos

## 13. DESIGN PRINCIPLES: THE SYNTHESIS

From studying 11 platforms, here are the design principles that separate apps people USE from apps people LOVE:

### 1. Content IS the decoration
Letterboxd's posters. Vivino's bottle labels. Food photos should BE the visual design of WGH, not illustrations decorating it.

### 2. Constraint creates identity
Letterboxd has one subject (film), one scale (stars), three colors. WGH has one island, one scale (Bite Slider), one question ("Would you order this again?"). That's not a limitation — it's the brand.

### 3. Rate fast, express slow
The default interaction should take 2 seconds (slide). The optional interaction should take 30 seconds (write a line, add a photo). Never make the slow path the only path.

### 4. Show people, not data
An activity feed of "Sarah rated the lobster roll 9.2" is warmer than "Average rating: 8.7 based on 312 votes." Both communicate quality. One communicates community.

### 5. Every rating is an investment
Vivino's "rate 5, get personalized recommendations" turns rating from a gift to the platform into an investment in yourself. WGH should activate this loop after 5 ratings.

### 6. Opinionated > neutral
The Infatuation's voice. Eater's "Essential" framing. WGH's Consensus Engine badges. The app should have a POINT OF VIEW. "This is GREAT" is more useful than "This is 4.3 stars."

### 7. Seasonal scarcity is a feature
Spotify Wrapped works because it's once a year. Martha's Vineyard works because it's one summer. "Your Vineyard Summer 2026" is not replicable by Yelp or Google.

### 8. The profile is a taste portrait
Letterboxd's four favorites. Untappd's badge collection. Beli's ranked list. Your profile should be a beautiful record of your taste, not a settings page.

---

## 14. PRIORITY ACTIONS FOR MEMORIAL DAY

Based on this research, ranked by impact:

### Must-Have (Before Launch)
1. **Dish photo grid that makes you hungry** — 2-column, large cards, hero photos dominate. The Browse page IS the product.
2. **One-swipe rating** — Bite Slider must be faster than Google's 4-tap star rating. Slide, confirm, done.
3. **Consensus badges visible everywhere** — "GREAT" (90%+) and "Great Here" (75%+) should appear on every dish card, not just the detail page.
4. **Numbered killer lists** — "#1 Lobster Roll on Martha's Vineyard" is the hook. Not "Top Lobster Rolls."

### Should-Have (First Two Weeks)
5. **"Trending This Week" section** — what's getting the most new high ratings right now? Hub page data, but also surface it on Home.
6. **First 5 badges** — Island Explorer, Seafood Scholar, First Bite, Menu Master, Summer 2026 Pioneer.
7. **"Wanna Try" list** — save dishes without login (localStorage), sync when they sign up.

### Build-Toward (Mid-Summer)
8. **Pioneer activity feed** — "What are the local foodies rating?"
9. **"Your Top 4 Dishes"** — profile feature. People will agonize over their picks.
10. **Auto dark mode after sunset** — Island Depths activates automatically in the evening.

### End-of-Summer Moment
11. **"Your Vineyard Summer"** — the Wrapped moment. $0 to build. Maximum viral potential.
