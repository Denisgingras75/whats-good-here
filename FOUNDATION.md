## The Problems (Why This Exists)

### 1. The 4.8-Star Lie
You type "best breakfast burrito near me" and Lookout Tavern comes up — 4.8 stars. No burrito on the menu. The 4.8 is an average across 300 menu items, thousands of reviews about parking, service, ambiance, wait times. It tells you nothing about any specific dish. **Star ratings rate restaurants. Nobody rates the food.**

### 2. The Bar Manager Problem
Running a bar, you can't get the word out about specials. Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, the website — you're posting the same thing 5 places and still nobody knows you have half-price oysters on Tuesday. Menus change every 3 months. You take a dish off that people loved and they never know. There's no central place for "what's happening at this restaurant right now."

### 3. The Local Knowledge Gap
You live on a small island. You know the bartenders, the owners, the chefs. But you still can't tell a tourist where there's a live band tonight. You don't know who has oysters on special. Your vegan friend visits and you're guessing. **The information exists in people's heads but not anywhere accessible.** If a local who knows everyone can't answer "what's good here" — how is a tourist supposed to figure it out?

## Who It's For

Three audiences, one flywheel:

### 1. Foodies (The Engine)
**Untappd for food. Goodreads for dishes.**

They document what they eat because they *love* food. They build the database just by using the app — every vote, every photo, every rating adds signal. Early adopter dynamic: like early Twitter, it starts empty but your friends use it, and it grows from there. The content bootstraps from the community.

**They get:** Taste identity, badges, "I found this spot first" social capital, a personal food journal, seeing how their taste compares to others.

### 2. Hungry People (The Demand)
**"What's good here?"**

In town for the first time, craving ramen — show me the 5 ramen spots near me, ranked by real people who actually ate there. Not reading 47 Yelp reviews. Just tell me: **which one is best, right now, near me.**

**They get:** Fast, trustworthy, dish-level answers powered by the foodie community.

### 3. Restaurants (The Business)
**Incentive to be good + centralized marketing.**

- Rankings create real accountability — your Lobster Roll is #3 or it's not
- **Data feedback:** Know which dishes people actually love (not just what sells)
- **Marketing hub** (like Untappd for breweries): events, specials, live music, vegan options, gluten-free dishes — all in one place instead of scattered across Instagram/Facebook/TikTok/website
- **Integration layer:** DoorDash, Uber Eats, Toast, Eet — become the place where restaurant presence is centralized

## The Flywheel

```
Foodies rate dishes → Rankings get better
    → Hungry people trust it → More users
        → Restaurants see traffic → They invest in their page
            → Events/specials/menus attract foodies → More ratings
```

## Comparable Apps

| App | What they did | WGH equivalent |
|-----|--------------|----------------|
| **Untappd** | Check in to beers, rate, badge system, brewery pages | Check in to dishes, rate, badges, restaurant pages |
| **Goodreads** | Track what you've read, see friends' reviews | Track what you've eaten, see friends' taste |
| **Early Twitter** | Empty until your friends joined, then indispensable | Same — foodies seed it, then it becomes the source |

---

## Core Principles

1. **Rate the dish, not the restaurant.** A mediocre restaurant can have one incredible dish. Yelp/Google rate the experience. WGH finds the specific thing worth ordering.

2. **Crowd truth over expert opinion.** "Would you order this again?" — binary yes/no plus a 1-10 scale. Not essays. Not influencer takes. Just honest signal from people who actually ate the food.

3. **Low-friction contribution.** A vote takes 5 seconds. No mandatory reviews. Photos optional. The bar to contribute is near-zero so data grows fast.

4. **In the moment.** Walk in → open app → GPS detects where you are → see what's good HERE, right NOW. The check-in is the Untappd moment — log that you're here, rate the dish, build your history.

5. **Restaurants get smarter.** Rankings are public accountability. But they're also a gift — real data about which dishes your customers love, which ones they skip, what they wish you had. Plus a central hub for events, specials, and everything else you're posting to 5 platforms.

6. **Data integrity is sacred.** One vote per user per dish. No paid placement. No influencer deals. If a mechanic risks inflating scores or biasing ratings, it doesn't ship.

## Revenue Paths

1. **Restaurant pages** — free basic, paid for promoted specials/events (Untappd playbook)
2. **Delivery integration** — "Order this dish" via DoorDash/Uber Eats/Toast (affiliate or API)
3. **Centralized marketing** — restaurants pay to manage events/specials/music in one dashboard instead of 5 platforms

## The Rants (Raw Founder Thinking)

These are the questions that keep coming up. They're not polished — they're the gut-level "why does nobody else see this?" moments that drive the whole thing.

### Why is texting the best way to get food specials to people?
It's 2026 and the most effective way a restaurant can tell you about tonight's special is a group text. Not an app, not a platform, not a feed — a text message. That's a broken market. There should be one place where "what's happening tonight" lives for every restaurant in your area. WGH is that place.

### Why can I review a broom handle but not a sandwich?
Amazon has 47 reviews on a $9 broom handle. Detailed breakdowns. Star ratings. Photos. "Verified purchase." But the $22 lobster roll you're about to order? Nothing. No dish-level reviews anywhere. Google rates the restaurant. Yelp rates the experience. **Nobody rates the actual food item.** You can review a broom handle on Amazon but you can't review a sandwich on any platform on earth. That's insane. WGH fixes this.

### Why does everyone blindly copy each other?
Yelp, Google, TripAdvisor, OpenTable — they all do the same thing. Rate the restaurant 1-5 stars, write a review, move on. Nobody stopped to ask: "Is rating a restaurant even the right unit?" The answer is no. The dish is the unit. But everyone copies the same broken model because it's what they've always seen. WGH breaks the pattern.

### What can DoorDash promote better?
DoorDash knows what people order. They know delivery times and reorder rates. But they can't tell you which dish at a restaurant is actually *good* — because they don't have dish-level ratings from people who ate in the restaurant. WGH has that data. Imagine DoorDash promoting "the #1 rated pizza within 2 miles" instead of "restaurants near you." That's a partnership. That's what granular dish-level data unlocks.

### How much data can we granulate?
Every vote is a data point: which dish, which restaurant, what rating, what time, what location, what category, how it compares to consensus, whether they'd order again. Multiply that across thousands of users and you have:
- **Dish-level demand signals** (what people actually want to eat, not just what they order on delivery apps)
- **Real-time trend data** (what's hot this week, this season, in this town)
- **Taste graph** (who likes what, taste compatibility between users, predictive recommendations)
- **Restaurant performance data** (which dishes are climbing, which are falling, competitive benchmarks)
- **Hyperlocal food intelligence** (what does Martha's Vineyard eat differently than Boston? What does the Tuesday crowd want vs. Saturday?)

This data doesn't exist anywhere else. Not on Yelp, not on Google, not on DoorDash. It's dish-level, crowd-sourced, real-time food intelligence. That's the long-term asset. That's what makes this worth building — and eventually, worth buying.

## Origin

Built by Denis Gingras — former bar manager on Martha's Vineyard who lived the problems firsthand. The idea started from a simple frustration: Google couldn't answer "what's the best breakfast burrito near me" and there was no way to tell tourists where the live music was tonight on a small island where you literally know the owners. A friend helped build out much of the initial code. The vision has always been the same: **Untappd, but for food.**
