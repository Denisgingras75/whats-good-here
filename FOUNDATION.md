## The Problems (Why This Exists)

### 1. The 4.8-Star Lie
You type "best breakfast burrito near me" and Lookout Tavern comes up — 4.8 stars. No burrito on the menu. The 4.8 is an average across 300 menu items, thousands of reviews about parking, service, ambiance, wait times. It tells you nothing about any specific dish. **Star ratings rate restaurants. Nobody rates the food.**

### 2. The Bar Manager Problem
Running a bar, you can't get the word out about specials. Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, the website — you're posting the same thing 5 places and still nobody knows you have half-price oysters on Tuesday. Menus change every 3 months. You take a dish off that people loved and they never know. There's no central place for "what's happening at this restaurant right now."

### 3. The Local Knowledge Gap
You live on a small island. You know the bartenders, the owners, the chefs. But you still can't tell a tourist where there's a live band tonight. You don't know who has oysters on special. Your vegan friend visits and you're guessing. **The information exists in people's heads but not anywhere accessible.** If a local who knows everyone can't answer "what's good here" — how is a tourist supposed to figure it out?

## Who It's For

Three audiences, one flywheel:

### 1. Foodies (The Engine)
**Untappd for food. Goodreads for dishes.**

They document what they eat because they *love* food. They build the database just by using the app — every vote, every photo, every rating adds signal. Early adopter dynamic: like early Twitter, it starts empty but your friends use it, and it grows from there. The content bootstraps from the community.

**They get:** Taste identity, badges, "I found this spot first" social capital, a personal food journal, seeing how their taste compares to others.

### 2. Hungry People (The Demand)
**"What's good here?"**

In town for the first time, craving ramen — show me the 5 ramen spots near me, ranked by real people who actually ate there. Not reading 47 Yelp reviews. Just tell me: **which one is best, right now, near me.**

**They get:** Fast, trustworthy, dish-level answers powered by the foodie community.

### 3. Restaurants (The Business)
**Incentive to be good + centralized marketing.**

- Rankings create real accountability — your Lobster Roll is #3 or it's not
- **Data feedback:** Know which dishes people actually love (not just what sells)
- **Marketing hub** (like Untappd for breweries): events, specials, live music, vegan options, gluten-free dishes — all in one place instead of scattered across Instagram/Facebook/TikTok/website
- **Integration layer:** DoorDash, Uber Eats, Toast, Eet — become the place where restaurant presence is centralized

## The Flywheel

```
Foodies rate dishes → Rankings get better
    → Hungry people trust it → More users
        → Restaurants see traffic → They invest in their page
            → Events/specials/menus attract foodies → More ratings
```

## Comparable Apps

| App | What they did | WGH equivalent |
|-----|--------------|----------------|
| **Untappd** | Check in to beers, rate, badge system, brewery pages | Check in to dishes, rate, badges, restaurant pages |
| **Goodreads** | Track what you've read, see friends' reviews | Track what you've eaten, see friends' taste |
| **Early Twitter** | Empty until your friends joined, then indispensable | Same — foodies seed it, then it becomes the source |

---

## Core Principles

1. **Rate the dish, not the restaurant.** A mediocre restaurant can have one incredible dish. Yelp/Google rate the experience. WGH finds the specific thing worth ordering.

2. **Crowd truth over expert opinion.** "Would you order this again?" — binary yes/no plus a 1-10 scale. Not essays. Not influencer takes. Just honest signal from people who actually ate the food.

3. **Low-friction contribution.** A vote takes 5 seconds. No mandatory reviews. Photos optional. The bar to contribute is near-zero so data grows fast.

4. **In the moment.** Walk in → open app → GPS detects where you are → see what's good HERE, right NOW. The check-in is the Untappd moment — log that you're here, rate the dish, build your history.

5. **Restaurants get smarter.** Rankings are public accountability. But they're also a gift — real data about which dishes your customers love, which ones they skip, what they wish you had. Plus a central hub for events, specials, and everything else you're posting to 5 platforms.

6. **Data integrity is sacred.** One vote per user per dish. No paid placement. No influencer deals. If a mechanic risks inflating scores or biasing ratings, it doesn't ship.

## Revenue Paths

1. **Restaurant pages** — free basic, paid for promoted specials/events (Untappd playbook)
2. **Delivery integration** — "Order this dish" via DoorDash/Uber Eats/Toast (affiliate or API)
3. **Centralized marketing** — restaurants pay to manage events/specials/music in one dashboard instead of 5 platforms

## Origin

Built by Denis Gingras — former bar manager on Martha's Vineyard who lived the problems firsthand. The idea started from a simple frustration: Google couldn't answer "what's the best breakfast burrito near me" and there was no way to tell tourists where the live music was tonight on a small island where you literally know the owners. A friend helped build out much of the initial code. The vision has always been the same: **Untappd, but for food.**
