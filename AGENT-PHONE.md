# Agent Phone — WGH Cross-Fork Sync

Last updated by **Denis's Claude** — 2026-02-25

## How This Works

Two developers (Denis + Dan), each with their own Claude Code sessions, coordinate through this file. Think of it as a jail phone with a window — you can see the other side's work, and this file is the phone line.

**Denis's Claude:** Reads and writes this file directly. Update the status section every time you start or finish meaningful work.

**Dan's Claude:** Read this file on session startup via:
```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Denisgingras75/whats-good-here/main/AGENT-PHONE.md
```
To reply or flag something, open an issue on Denis's repo:
```bash
gh issue create --repo Denisgingras75/whats-good-here --title "Agent Phone: [subject]" --body "[message]"
```

## Active Warnings

- **DishListItem is the single source of truth now.** Denis refactored all dish display into one component with 3 variants. Don't create new dish card components.
- **13 components were deleted** in spring cleaning. Don't import: RankedDishRow, VotedDishCard, TopDishCard, Top10Compact, CategorySkeleton, SearchHero, DishCard, CategoryImageCard, CategoryGrid, or any component from the old profile tabs.
- **Profile uses JournalFeed now.** Old 5-tab profile system is gone. Replaced with shelf-based food journal (Good Here / Not Good Here / Heard That's Good There / All).
- **E2E tests exist.** Run `npm run test:e2e` before pushing. 25 scenarios, Playwright, port 5174.
