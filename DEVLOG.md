### Homepage Simplification
- Removed emoji medals (🥇🥈🥉🏆) from Top 10 — replaced with typography-only rank numbers (red for top 3)
- Removed bordered card wrapper around Top 10 list (border, box-shadow, inner glow)
- Removed decorative radial gradients from SearchHero
- Removed uppercase tracked "BROWSE BY CATEGORY" section header
- Simplified expand/collapse to plain text (no chevron icon, no border-top)
- Moved category scroll from separate section to inside SearchHero, under town picker
- Category pills: removed borders, use subtle elevated background with category photos

### Color Palette
- Explored color ring palette redesign (branch `experiment/color-ring-palette-v2`)
- Vivid Red + Bright Yellow palette tested and reverted — too primary-colored, read as cheap
- Reverted to original Island Depths palette (Deep Rust + Warm Gold)
- Fixed `--color-divider` from gold tint to rust tint — gold at low opacity on dark navy produced a green appearance

### New Categories
- Added fish, clams, chicken, pork to `BROWSE_CATEGORIES` (now 18 shortcuts)

### Social Features - Major Overhaul
Complete social system replacing global leaderboards with friend-based discovery:

#### Follows System
- Created `follows` table with one-way Twitter-style following
- Denormalized `follower_count` and `following_count` on profiles for performance
- Database trigger auto-updates counts on follow/unfollow
- Created `followsApi.js` with follow/unfollow/isFollowing methods

#### Public User Profiles (`/user/:id`)
- New `UserProfile.jsx` page showing any user's public profile
- Stats: dishes rated, Worth It count, Avoid count, avg rating
- Rating personality based on avg rating (Loves Everything, Generous Rater, Fair Judge, Tough Critic)
- Recent ratings with dish photos and community comparison
- Follow/unfollow button with real-time count updates

#### User Search
- `UserSearch.jsx` component with debounced search
- Search users by display name
- Shows follower count, follow status, quick follow button
- Expandable "Find Friends" section on Profile page

#### Followers/Following Modal
- `FollowListModal.jsx` shows full lists when tapping follower/following counts
- Click any user to visit their profile

#### In-App Notifications
- `notifications` table with trigger on new follows
- `NotificationBell.jsx` with unread count badge (polls every 30s)
- Dropdown showing recent notifications
- Auto-marks as read when viewed

#### Rating Comparisons on Friend Profiles
- When viewing a friend's recent ratings, shows your rating of the same dish
- Shows community average with delta (how friend rated vs community)
- "You: 8/10 (+2)" style comparison

#### Bug Fixes
- Fixed floating point display errors (was showing "-0.6000000000000005")
- Added `Math.round((value) * 10) / 10` for clean decimal display
- Share button now only shows on your OWN profile, not others'
- Fixed `badge_key` → `key` mapping for badges on friend profiles

#### Database Migrations
- `add-follows-table.sql` - follows table, triggers, RPC functions
- `add-notifications.sql` - notifications table and follow trigger

#### Known Issues Being Fixed
- Badges showing on friend profiles (data is there, rendering issue)
- Historical follow counts need manual sync (trigger added after some follows existed)
- Historical badges need evaluation for existing users

- Subtle entrance animations: logo fade-up, staggered text fade-ins

### API Layer Abstraction
- Created `src/api/` folder with modular services
- Added `dishesApi`, `restaurantsApi`, `votesApi`, `favoritesApi`, `adminApi`, `authApi`, `profileApi`

### Error Handling
- Added `src/utils/errorHandler.js` with error classification
- User-friendly error messages for network, auth, timeout errors
- Exponential backoff retry logic with `withRetry()`

### Hook Migration
- Migrated `useProfile`, `useUserVotes`, `useFavorites` to use API layer
- No more direct Supabase calls outside of `src/api/` and `AuthContext`

### Testing
- Added `authApi.test.js` for auth API coverage
- Upgraded `@testing-library/react` to v16 for React 19 support

### UX Improvements
- Profile tabs now sort dishes by rating (highest first), unrated dishes at end

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed memory leak in `LocationContext` - geolocation permission listener now properly cleaned up
- Fixed unreliable search filtering in Browse - wrapped `filteredDishes` in `useMemo` with proper dependencies
- Fixed modal not reopening after magic link login - removed unreliable `setTimeout(100)`, opens immediately
- Fixed slow initial load - app no longer blocks on geolocation, dishes load instantly with default MV location
