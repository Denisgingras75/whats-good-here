### API Layer Abstraction
- Created `src/api/` folder with modular services
- Added `dishesApi`, `restaurantsApi`, `votesApi`, `favoritesApi`, `adminApi`, `authApi`, `profileApi`
- Central `index.js` exporter for clean imports

### Error Handling
- Added `src/utils/errorHandler.js` with error classification
- User-friendly error messages for network, auth, timeout errors
- Exponential backoff retry logic with `withRetry()`

### Hook Migration
- Migrated `useProfile`, `useUserVotes`, `useFavorites` to use API layer
- No more direct Supabase calls outside of `src/api/` and `AuthContext`

### Testing
- Added `authApi.test.js` for auth API coverage
- Upgraded `@testing-library/react` to v16 for React 19 support

### UX Improvements
- Profile tabs now sort dishes by rating (highest first), unrated dishes at end
