## 2026-02-15 - Daniel + Claude (Session 2)

### T26: Homepage Brand Signature
- **Brand font:** Aglet Sans Bold (700) at 30px for all "What's Good Here" headings (SearchHero, WelcomeSplash, WelcomeModal, Login)
- **Adobe Fonts (Typekit):** Added `use.typekit.net/yxz4cgv.css` for Aglet Sans; fixed CSP in `vercel.json` to allow typekit domains on deployed versions
- **Two-font system:** Aglet Sans Bold (brand header only) + DM Sans (everything else). Tried Bryant Condensed, Clone Rounded, Informa Pro, Fira Sans — stripped back to avoid font sprawl
- **#1 Hero Card:** New `NumberOneHero` component — typographic hero announcement for the top-ranked dish. Gold accent border, Aglet Sans dish name, uppercase restaurant, large rating number. Top10Compact now starts at rank #2
- **"The Contenders"** section header replaces "Top 10 Right Now" for ranks #2-10
- **Inline search:** Search results now render directly on the homepage (no page navigation). DishSearch accepts `onSearchChange` prop for inline mode. "Show more" button paginates results in batches of 10
- **Category nav redesign:** Multiple iterations (circles → pills → text labels → back to smaller 44px circles with food photos). Final: compact photo circles + text labels in horizontal scroll with town picker
- **Trust signal exploration:** Tried live stats (votes, restaurants, dishes) under header — numbers too small to be credible yet. Reverted to "the #1 bite near you" tagline

### UX Fixes (Feb 16)
- **Town picker scroll:** Fixed horizontal swipe scrolling the whole page — moved `overflow-x-auto` to outer container, added `touch-action: pan-x` and `overscroll-behavior-x: contain`
- **Town picker flash:** Removed `transition-all` from TownPicker buttons to prevent red background flash when closing
- **Town picker scroll reset:** Scroll position resets to beginning when town picker closes so categories start from the left
- **Town picker icon:** Red location pin over ocean waves (replaced generic gold pin)
- **Category circles:** Restored to 56px (were shrunk to 44px, looked unintentional on mobile)

### Files changed
- `index.html` — Typekit CSS import
- `vercel.json` — CSP for typekit domains (style-src, font-src)
- `src/components/home/SearchHero.jsx` — Aglet Sans, onSearchChange prop
- `src/components/home/Top10Compact.jsx` — startRank prop, "The Contenders" header
- `src/components/DishSearch.jsx` — onSearchChange inline mode
- `src/pages/Home.jsx` — NumberOneHero, CategoryNav, inline search, scroll fixes
- `src/components/TownPicker.jsx` — Red pin, removed transition flash, scroll behavior
- `src/components/WelcomeSplash.jsx` — Aglet Sans font
- `src/components/Auth/WelcomeModal.jsx` — Aglet Sans font
- `src/pages/Login.jsx` — Aglet Sans font

### Bug Fixes
- **T32:** Fixed DishSearch inputRef null check — added optional chaining to `inputRef.current?.contains()` in click-outside handler
- **T31:** Added error handling to Profile/Browse async operations — `handleSaveName` try-catch with user error message, `handleVote` refetch try-catch, `adminApi.isAdmin()` catch handler, `handleToggleFavorite` try-catch in Browse.jsx

### Resend Email Setup (In Progress)
- Resend account created, domain `wghapp.com` purchased and verified
- SMTP credentials configured in Supabase Auth settings (host: smtp.resend.com, port: 465, username: resend)
- **Blocked:** Resend had a service outage during testing, and API key was accidentally deleted
- **Next:** Once Resend is back up, create new API key, update Supabase SMTP password, test magic link delivery
- Note: Earlier test failures were due to using `user_repeated_signup` (existing account) which Supabase silently no-ops — need to test with magic link login or fresh email

### T28 Rescoped
- `react-helmet-async` doesn't support React 19 (peer dep conflict)
- Client-side meta tags don't help anyway — social crawlers (Facebook, iMessage, Twitter) don't execute JS
- Rescoped T28 to Vercel edge middleware approach, deferred to pre-launch
- Middleware will detect crawler user agents, fetch data from Supabase, return HTML with correct og tags

### Next Up
- Resend API key recreation + email delivery verification
- T26 (homepage polish), T27 (OG image), T29 (apple-touch-icon)

### Homepage Simplification
- Removed emoji medals (🥇🥈🥉🏆) from Top 10 — replaced with typography-only rank numbers (red for top 3)
- Removed bordered card wrapper around Top 10 list (border, box-shadow, inner glow)
- Removed decorative radial gradients from SearchHero
- Removed uppercase tracked "BROWSE BY CATEGORY" section header
- Simplified expand/collapse to plain text (no chevron icon, no border-top)
- Moved category scroll from separate section to inside SearchHero, under town picker
- Category pills: removed borders, use subtle elevated background with category photos

### Color Palette
- Explored color ring palette redesign (branch `experiment/color-ring-palette-v2`)
- Vivid Red + Bright Yellow palette tested and reverted — too primary-colored, read as cheap
- Reverted to original Island Depths palette (Deep Rust + Warm Gold)
- Fixed `--color-divider` from gold tint to rust tint — gold at low opacity on dark navy produced a green appearance

### New Categories
- Added fish, clams, chicken, pork to `BROWSE_CATEGORIES` (now 18 shortcuts)

- Fixed `badge_key` → `key` mapping for badges on friend profiles
