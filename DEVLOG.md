### Light Mode Default + V1 Theme + Hero Card Redesign

**Theme overhaul:**
- Light mode ("Appetite") is now the default — every user tested preferred it
- Swapped CSS: light is `:root`, dark is `[data-theme="dark"]`
- Reverted light theme from V2 (peach/copper everywhere) to V1 (white cards, orange-red primary, neutral gray text)
- Primary coral richer: `#E8663C` → `#E45A35`
- Medal gold warmer: `#B8860B` → `#C48A12` (amber, no olive undertone)
- Fixed `getCategoryNeonImage()` theme detection for new default
- Search bars on all pages now use `var(--color-bg)` for consistent white look
- Removed border from Restaurants Open/Closed tab switcher

**#1 Hero card — dramatic redesign:**
- Dish name: 24→28px, weight 800, gold medal color
- Rating: 28→36px with breathing room
- "#1 in..." label: tighter tracking (0.06em), smaller (13px) — whispers, doesn't compete
- Gold left border 4px with soft amber edge glow
- Floating card shadow for depth
- More padding throughout

**Typography hierarchy tightened:**
- "What's Good Here" brand: 30→32px, weight 800, tighter tracking
- Tagline: lighter weight (400), tertiary color, wider tracking — recedes

**Contender rows:**
- Silver podium: rank 22→24px, name 15→17px
- Bronze podium: rank 20→22px, name 14→16px
- Category icons: soft floating shadows, 1.05x scale on active

**Category strip removed** — icons sit directly on surface with peach circle backgrounds matching PNG assets

### Files changed
- `src/index.css` — Theme swap (light=:root, dark=[data-theme="dark"]), new tokens
- `src/context/ThemeContext.jsx` — Default 'light', apply dark via data-theme="dark"
- `src/constants/categories.js` — Fixed theme detection for icon sets
- `src/pages/Home.jsx` — Hero card redesign, category icon shadows/scale, typography
- `src/components/home/SearchHero.jsx` — Surface background, heavier brand title
- `src/components/home/Top10Compact.jsx` — Bigger silver/bronze podium sizing
- `src/components/TownPicker.jsx` — Category strip background with border
- `src/pages/Restaurants.jsx` — White search bar, removed tab border
- `src/components/UserSearch.jsx` — White search bar
- `CLAUDE.md` — Updated design tokens, theme default docs
- `TASKS.md` — T26 progress updated

---

### Contender Row Reading Flow + Expandable Category Lists
- **Reading flow fix:** Moved rating + vote count below restaurant name in all contender rows (ranks 2-10), matching the hero card's top-to-bottom scan pattern. Removes eye zigzag to far-right rating column.
- **Podium rows (2-3):** Rating line now reads `8.3 · 10 votes` below restaurant name, green rating color preserved
- **Finalist rows (4-10):** Same rating placement, chevron removed (stacked layout already feels tappable)
- **Expandable category lists:** When clicking a category shortcut (e.g. Burgers), shows first 10 dishes with "Show all N [Category]" button to expand the full list. Collapses back with "Show less". Resets on category switch (component remounts via `key` prop).
- Removed unused `onSeeAll` prop from Top10Compact

### Files changed
- `src/components/home/Top10Compact.jsx` — Stacked rating layout, expand/collapse state, removed chevron
- `src/pages/Home.jsx` — Removed `.slice(0, 10)` cap on category-filtered dishes

---

### Theme-Aware Category Icons
- **Light mode icons:** Generated all 19 category icons with copper peach `#F2CDBC` (30% card color) circular backgrounds using Zach Roszczewski flat vector style — rich saturated mid-tones that pop against the warm stone `#F0ECE8` background
- **Dark mode icons:** Added missing icons for fish, clams, chicken, pork with `#1B2837` backgrounds to match existing dark icons
- **Seafood swap:** Old seafood icon (was a fish) → renamed to fish. New seafood icon is a seafood boil (shrimp, corn, shellfish) to differentiate
- **Theme-aware switching:** `getCategoryNeonImage()` now reads `data-theme` attribute to serve the correct icon set. Falls back to dark icons if light variant is missing
- **Prompt templates saved** to NOTES.md for both dark (`#1B2837` bg) and light (`#F2CDBC` bg) with all 19 category-specific color palettes
- Images stored in `public/categories/` with `-light.png` suffix for light variants
- Mapping in `CATEGORY_IMAGES_DARK` / `CATEGORY_IMAGES_LIGHT` in `src/constants/categories.js`

### Files changed
- `src/constants/categories.js` — Theme-aware image maps and `getCategoryNeonImage()` logic
- `public/categories/*-light.png` — 19 new light mode icons
- `public/categories/{fish,clams,chicken,pork,seafood}.png` — New/updated dark mode icons
- `NOTES.md` — Prompt templates for both themes

### 60/30/10 Color Ratio (Light Mode)
- Applied food psychology 60/30/10 ratio to light theme — proper layer separation
- **60% (The Table):** Warm stone backdrop `#F0ECE8`, surface `#E8D4C8`
- **30% (The Room):** Orange-red appetite atmosphere — cards `#F2CDBC`, hover `#EBC2AE`, elevated `#EFCFBE`. Like sitting in a restaurant with terracotta walls and warm lighting
- **10% (The Dish):** Deep warm crimson `#9E2B1E` replaces orange-red for primary accent. Pops against warm orange surfaces without competing. Crimson CTAs, headers, active states
- **Text:** Neutral slate grays replaced with warm taupe (`#7A6E62`, `#A89888`) so text recedes into warm atmosphere. Primary text `#3A2818` (warm dark brown) for outdoor readability on MV
- **Danger color** aligned to new primary crimson
- Glow/focus tokens updated to match new primary
- Dark mode untouched — was already hitting the ratio

### #1 Hero Card Color Hierarchy
- **"#1 IN {TOWN} RIGHT NOW"** label: gold → crimson `var(--color-primary)`, bumped from 10px to 16px — the #1 announcement should command attention, not whisper
- **Dish name:** text-primary → gold `var(--color-medal-gold)` — completes the medal hierarchy (gold #1, silver #2, bronze #3)
- Tightened letter-spacing on label from 0.16em to 0.10em at larger size

### Docs Updated
- Updated light mode design tokens in `CLAUDE.md` and `NOTES.md` to reflect 60/30/10 ratio with layer annotations (60% backdrop, 30% atmosphere, 10% accent)

### Files changed
- `src/index.css` — All light mode token values (primary, cards, text, surfaces, glow, focus)
- `src/pages/Home.jsx` — NumberOneHero color hierarchy (crimson label, gold dish name, larger label)
- `CLAUDE.md` — Light mode design tokens table
- `NOTES.md` — Light mode design tokens table

## 2026-02-15 - Daniel + Claude (Session 2)

### T26: Homepage Brand Signature
- **Brand font:** Aglet Sans Bold (700) at 30px for all "What's Good Here" headings (SearchHero, WelcomeSplash, WelcomeModal, Login)
- **Adobe Fonts (Typekit):** Added `use.typekit.net/yxz4cgv.css` for Aglet Sans; fixed CSP in `vercel.json` to allow typekit domains on deployed versions
- **Two-font system:** Aglet Sans Bold (brand header only) + DM Sans (everything else). Tried Bryant Condensed, Clone Rounded, Informa Pro, Fira Sans — stripped back to avoid font sprawl
- **#1 Hero Card:** New `NumberOneHero` component — typographic hero announcement for the top-ranked dish. Gold accent border, Aglet Sans dish name, uppercase restaurant, large rating number. Top10Compact now starts at rank #2
- **"The Contenders"** section header replaces "Top 10 Right Now" for ranks #2-10
- **Inline search:** Search results now render directly on the homepage (no page navigation). DishSearch accepts `onSearchChange` prop for inline mode. "Show more" button paginates results in batches of 10
- **Category nav redesign:** Multiple iterations (circles → pills → text labels → back to smaller 44px circles with food photos). Final: compact photo circles + text labels in horizontal scroll with town picker
- **Trust signal exploration:** Tried live stats (votes, restaurants, dishes) under header — numbers too small to be credible yet. Reverted to "the #1 bite near you" tagline

### UX Fixes (Feb 16)
- **Town picker scroll:** Fixed horizontal swipe scrolling the whole page — moved `overflow-x-auto` to outer container, added `touch-action: pan-x` and `overscroll-behavior-x: contain`
- **Town picker flash:** Removed `transition-all` from TownPicker buttons to prevent red background flash when closing
- **Town picker scroll reset:** Scroll position resets to beginning when town picker closes so categories start from the left
- **Town picker icon:** Red location pin over ocean waves (replaced generic gold pin)
- **Category circles:** Restored to 56px (were shrunk to 44px, looked unintentional on mobile)

### Files changed
- `index.html` — Typekit CSS import
- `vercel.json` — CSP for typekit domains (style-src, font-src)
- `src/components/home/SearchHero.jsx` — Aglet Sans, onSearchChange prop
- `src/components/home/Top10Compact.jsx` — startRank prop, "The Contenders" header
- `src/components/DishSearch.jsx` — onSearchChange inline mode
- `src/pages/Home.jsx` — NumberOneHero, CategoryNav, inline search, scroll fixes
- `src/components/TownPicker.jsx` — Red pin, removed transition flash, scroll behavior
- `src/components/WelcomeSplash.jsx` — Aglet Sans font
- `src/components/Auth/WelcomeModal.jsx` — Aglet Sans font
- `src/pages/Login.jsx` — Aglet Sans font

### Bug Fixes
- **T32:** Fixed DishSearch inputRef null check — added optional chaining to `inputRef.current?.contains()` in click-outside handler
- **T31:** Added error handling to Profile/Browse async operations — `handleSaveName` try-catch with user error message, `handleVote` refetch try-catch, `adminApi.isAdmin()` catch handler, `handleToggleFavorite` try-catch in Browse.jsx

### Resend Email Setup (In Progress)
- Resend account created, domain `wghapp.com` purchased and verified
- SMTP credentials configured in Supabase Auth settings (host: smtp.resend.com, port: 465, username: resend)
- **Blocked:** Resend had a service outage during testing, and API key was accidentally deleted
- **Next:** Once Resend is back up, create new API key, update Supabase SMTP password, test magic link delivery
- Note: Earlier test failures were due to using `user_repeated_signup` (existing account) which Supabase silently no-ops — need to test with magic link login or fresh email

### T28 Rescoped
- `react-helmet-async` doesn't support React 19 (peer dep conflict)
- Client-side meta tags don't help anyway — social crawlers (Facebook, iMessage, Twitter) don't execute JS
- Rescoped T28 to Vercel edge middleware approach, deferred to pre-launch
- Middleware will detect crawler user agents, fetch data from Supabase, return HTML with correct og tags

### Next Up
- Resend API key recreation + email delivery verification
- T26 (homepage polish), T27 (OG image), T29 (apple-touch-icon)

### Homepage Simplification
- Removed emoji medals (🥇🥈🥉🏆) from Top 10 — replaced with typography-only rank numbers (red for top 3)
- Removed bordered card wrapper around Top 10 list (border, box-shadow, inner glow)
- Removed decorative radial gradients from SearchHero
- Removed uppercase tracked "BROWSE BY CATEGORY" section header
- Simplified expand/collapse to plain text (no chevron icon, no border-top)
- Moved category scroll from separate section to inside SearchHero, under town picker
- Category pills: removed borders, use subtle elevated background with category photos

### Color Palette
- Explored color ring palette redesign (branch `experiment/color-ring-palette-v2`)
- Vivid Red + Bright Yellow palette tested and reverted — too primary-colored, read as cheap
- Reverted to original Island Depths palette (Deep Rust + Warm Gold)
- Fixed `--color-divider` from gold tint to rust tint — gold at low opacity on dark navy produced a green appearance

### New Categories
- Added fish, clams, chicken, pork to `BROWSE_CATEGORIES` (now 18 shortcuts)
